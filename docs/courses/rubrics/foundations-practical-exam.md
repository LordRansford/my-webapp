# Cybersecurity Foundations - Practical Exam Rubric

## Overview
The practical exam consists of three tasks designed to assess applied cybersecurity knowledge gained throughout the Foundations level. Students have 90 minutes (suggested) to complete all tasks.

## Grading Scale
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Exceeds expectations, demonstrates mastery
- **Proficient (70-89%)**: Meets expectations, demonstrates competence
- **Developing (50-69%)**: Partially meets expectations, needs improvement
- **Beginning (0-49%)**: Does not meet expectations, requires significant development

## Task 1: Phishing Email Analysis (30 points)

### Description
Analyze 3 provided email examples and identify whether each is phishing or legitimate. For phishing emails, identify specific indicators and explain the attack vector.

### Rubric

**Email Classification (9 points - 3 points per email)**
- 3 points: Correct classification with confidence assessment
- 2 points: Correct classification without clear reasoning
- 1 point: Incorrect classification but demonstrates some understanding
- 0 points: Incorrect classification with no valid reasoning

**Indicator Identification (12 points - 4 points per phishing email)**
- 4 points: Identifies 4+ specific indicators with technical accuracy
- 3 points: Identifies 3 specific indicators correctly
- 2 points: Identifies 1-2 indicators with some accuracy
- 1 point: Attempts identification but indicators are vague or incorrect
- 0 points: No valid indicators identified

**Risk Assessment (9 points - 3 points per email)**
- 3 points: Explains attack vector, likely target, and potential impact
- 2 points: Explains attack vector and one other element
- 1 point: Provides basic explanation without depth
- 0 points: No meaningful risk assessment

## Task 2: Attack Surface Diagram (35 points)

### Description
Create an attack surface diagram for a provided scenario (e.g., small business with website, email, and file sharing). Identify entry points, trust boundaries, and data flows.

### Rubric

**Diagram Completeness (15 points)**
- 15 points: All major components identified with clear relationships
- 12 points: Most components identified, minor gaps
- 9 points: Key components present but significant gaps
- 6 points: Diagram incomplete or poorly organized
- 0-5 points: Diagram missing or incomprehensible

**Entry Point Identification (10 points)**
- 10 points: Identifies all major entry points with risk classification
- 8 points: Identifies most entry points, minor omissions
- 6 points: Identifies some entry points but misses critical ones
- 4 points: Few entry points identified
- 0-3 points: Entry points not identified or incorrect

**Trust Boundaries (10 points)**
- 10 points: Clearly marks trust boundaries with justification
- 8 points: Trust boundaries marked, minor errors
- 6 points: Some boundaries identified but incomplete
- 4 points: Trust boundaries unclear or incorrect
- 0-3 points: No meaningful trust boundary analysis

## Task 3: Breach Incident Report (35 points)

### Description
Read a provided breach scenario (200-300 words describing an incident). Write a 2-page incident report covering: What happened, how it happened, what failed, and 3 recommended preventive controls.

### Rubric

**Incident Summary (8 points)**
- 8 points: Clear, accurate, well-organized summary of events
- 6 points: Summary covers key points, minor organizational issues
- 4 points: Summary incomplete or contains inaccuracies
- 2 points: Summary vague or poorly structured
- 0-1 points: No meaningful summary provided

**Root Cause Analysis (9 points)**
- 9 points: Accurately identifies root cause with supporting evidence
- 7 points: Identifies root cause, minor gaps in reasoning
- 5 points: Partial identification of root cause
- 3 points: Root cause analysis is superficial
- 0-2 points: No valid root cause analysis

**Failed Controls Analysis (9 points)**
- 9 points: Identifies 3+ failed controls with clear explanation
- 7 points: Identifies 2-3 failed controls adequately
- 5 points: Identifies 1-2 failed controls with limited detail
- 3 points: Attempts to identify controls but lacks understanding
- 0-2 points: No meaningful analysis of failed controls

**Preventive Recommendations (9 points - 3 points each)**
- 3 points: Recommendation is specific, feasible, and addresses root cause
- 2 points: Recommendation is relevant but lacks specificity
- 1 point: Recommendation is generic or weakly justified
- 0 points: Recommendation is irrelevant or demonstrates misunderstanding

## Overall Assessment

### Passing Criteria
- **Minimum score**: 70/100 (70%)
- Must demonstrate competency across all three tasks
- Partial credit available for incomplete but conceptually sound work

### Retake Policy
- Students scoring below 70% may retake once after reviewing feedback
- Alternative version of exam provided for retakes

### Time Recommendations
- Task 1 (Phishing Analysis): 20-25 minutes
- Task 2 (Attack Surface Diagram): 30-35 minutes
- Task 3 (Incident Report): 30-35 minutes
- Review: 5 minutes

## Feedback Guidelines

For each task, provide:
1. **Strengths**: What the student did well
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Specific gaps or errors
3. **Resources**: Point to specific module sections for review
4. **Encouragement**: Recognize effort and progress

## Academic Integrity

- Open book/notes exam—students may reference course materials
- No collaboration with others during exam
- No use of AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) for generating answers
- Plagiarism from external sources not permitted
- Suspected violations reviewed individually

## Accommodations

Students requiring accommodations should request them before beginning the exam:
- Extended time (up to 50% additional)
- Alternative format (oral presentation, extended written response)
- Assistive technology as needed

## Instructor Notes

**Common Mistakes to Watch For:**
- Confusing authentication with authorization
- Mixing up hashing and encryption
- Identifying symptoms rather than root causes
- Recommending controls that don't address identified vulnerabilities
- Using jargon without demonstrating understanding

**Grading Consistency:**
- Use rubric strictly to ensure fairness
- Provide written feedback for scores below 80%
- Grade anonymously where possible
- Review sample answers before grading to calibrate expectations
