## Portfolio Integration

All capstone projects become part of student's CPD portfolio and can be:
- Included in job applications
- Shared with managers for professional development discussions
- Used as evidence for certification applications
- Built upon in Intermediate and Advanced levels

Students are encouraged to treat capstone as showcase work, not just an assessment.
