# Cybersecurity Foundations - course specification

## Overview

**Course name:** Cybersecurity Foundations  
**Level:** 1 of 3 in the Cybersecurity Notes course  
**Delivery mode:** Self paced online notes with embedded tools and labs  
**Estimated guided learning hours:** 10  

This level is designed for learners who are new to technical topics. It introduces core cybersecurity ideas using simple language, everyday examples, basic maths and interactive browser based tools.

## Audience

- Children and young people who are starting to use digital devices and services.
- Adults who do not see themselves as “technical” but want to be safer online.
- Professionals from non technical backgrounds who need a foundation before deeper study or certifications.
- Teams and classes who want an accessible introduction they can work through together.

No prior technical knowledge is required. The only assumption is basic familiarity with everyday digital devices and the internet.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of Cybersecurity Foundations, learners will be able to:

1. Explain what data, bits, bytes and encodings are and why small changes in data matter for security.
2. Describe the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability in simple language with everyday examples.
3. Recognise in plain terms how information moves between devices and across networks at a high level.
4. Explain what a trust boundary and attack surface are, with simple examples from home and work life.
5. Use the hashing and encoding tools to see how small changes in input create large changes in output and relate this to integrity.
6. Use the password and URL tools to judge the strength of passwords and the safety of basic links or emails.
7. Describe preventive, detective and corrective controls and give examples of each.
8. Record simple risks and controls in a risk matrix and justify chosen likelihood and impact in plain terms.

## Module structure

The Foundations content is organised into five modules on a single page:

1. Module 1: Data, bits, bytes and encoding  
2. Module 2: Devices, networks and basic plumbing  
3. Module 3: Threats, attackers and basic defences  
4. Module 4: Authentication, passwords and everyday privacy  
5. Module 5: Foundations checkpoint and labs  

Each module combines short explanatory sections with at least one embedded interactive tool and a short lab.

## Embedded tools and labs

Tools are embedded directly in the browser and do not require any installation. For example:

- Hashing and bit flip playground.  
- Encoding explorer (ASCII and UTF 8).  
- Phishing and URL checker with sample scenarios.  
- Password strength and guessability lab.  
- Simple risk matrix dashboard.

Each tool is wrapped as a named lab with:

- A lab title and objective.
- Step by step instructions.
- Reflection questions.

## Assessment

At this level assessment is light but structured:

- Each module includes unmarked reflection questions.
- Module 5 includes a short checkpoint with 6 to 8 questions that cover the main concepts.
- Learners are encouraged to record at least one behaviour change they will make based on the course.

This assessment structure is suitable for CPD credit. More formal summative assessment can be added later if required.

## Alignment with CISSP domains

Cybersecurity Foundations is aligned at a high level with the following CISSP knowledge areas:

- Domain 1: Security and Risk Management - basic concepts such as CIA, risk, controls and ethics.
- Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering - introductory ideas about secure design and trust boundaries.
- Domain 4: Communication and Network Security - high level understanding of how data moves between devices and networks.
- Domain 5: Identity and Access Management - basic authentication and password concepts.
- Domain 7: Security Operations - introductory ideas about logging, monitoring and incident thinking.

This level does not attempt to cover the full CISSP body of knowledge. It aims to build the underlying understanding that later maps into formal exam preparation.

## Alignment with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0

The Foundations level primarily supports the following NIST CSF 2.0 functions:

- Identify: recognising assets, data, basic risks and roles.
- Protect: applying basic safeguards such as passwords, multi factor authentication and safe behaviours.
- Detect: beginning to recognise suspicious emails, links and device behaviour.

The Govern function is introduced in very light form by encouraging responsible and ethical behaviour online.

## Alignment with Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus

Cybersecurity Foundations introduces the five Cyber Essentials control themes at a basic level:

- Firewalls and internet gateways - explained via simple network and device analogies.
- Secure configuration - simple examples of changing default settings.
- User access control - basic account and password practices.
- Malware protection - high level view of antivirus and safe software behaviour.
- Patch management - the idea of keeping devices and apps updated.

Cyber Essentials Plus aspects, such as testing and verification, are not addressed directly at this level but are set up conceptually for later levels.

## Accessibility and inclusivity

The content and tools are designed to be accessible:

- Simple language and short sentences.
- Clear explanations of technical terms on first use.
- High contrast text and support for dark and light themes.
- Keyboard accessible interactive elements where possible.
- Captions and transcripts for audio or video material.

This supports a wide range of learners, including those with low digital confidence.
