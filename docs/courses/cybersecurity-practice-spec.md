# Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy - course specification

## Overview

**Course name:** Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy  
**Level:** 3 of 3 in the Cybersecurity Notes course  
**Delivery mode:** Self paced online notes with embedded tools, labs and scenarios  
**Estimated guided learning hours:** 14  

This level is for people who want to think and act like security engineers, architects and leaders. It assumes the Foundations and Applied levels or equivalent experience. The focus is on joining up technical detail, design, operations and governance so that learners can reason about security in real organisations.

## Audience

- Learners who have completed the Foundations and Applied levels.
- Security practitioners who want a structured way to connect technical work with risk and governance.
- Architects, engineers and product owners who own digital systems and services.
- Leaders and advisors who need to interpret security information and make decisions.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy, learners will be able to:

1. Describe and critique secure architecture patterns for common web, cloud and integration scenarios.
2. Explain how cryptography is used in practice for confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non repudiation, and recognise common misuse patterns.
3. Apply secure software development and DevSecOps ideas to simple delivery pipelines and change processes.
4. Describe core security operations practices including logging, monitoring, threat intelligence, vulnerability management and incident response.
5. Use risk thinking to prioritise vulnerabilities and controls for a small but realistic system.
6. Explain how frameworks such as CISSP, NIST CSF 2.0 and Cyber Essentials Plus fit into a broader governance and assurance story.
7. Communicate security decisions in clear, non technical language while preserving the important detail.

## Module structure

The Practice and Strategy content is organised into seven modules on a single page:

1. Module 1: Secure architecture in the real world  
2. Module 2: Cryptography in practice  
3. Module 3: Secure software development and DevSecOps  
4. Module 4: Security operations, monitoring and incident response  
5. Module 5: Vulnerability management and threat intelligence  
6. Module 6: Governance, compliance and ethics  
7. Module 7: Capstone scenarios and labs  

Each module combines narrative explanations, diagrams and at least one interactive lab or dashboard.

## Embedded tools and labs

Examples of tools and labs used at this level include:

- A mini secure architecture designer where learners place components such as identity providers, gateways, services and logging.
- A cryptography usage explorer that shows where hashing, encryption and signing are applied in different flows.
- A DevSecOps pipeline simulator that shows how code, tests, scans and approvals move through environments.
- A security operations dashboard with sample logs, alerts and incident timelines.
- A vulnerability and risk triage view where learners prioritise fixes based on likelihood, impact and business context.
- Governance and policy scenarios where learners choose controls and justify decisions.

Each lab has:

- A clear title and objective.
- Step by step instructions.
- Reflection questions that tie back to risk, trade offs and human impact.

## Alignment with CISSP domains

Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy has the strongest mapping to CISSP knowledge areas, including:

- Domain 1: Security and Risk Management - real world risk and governance practice.
- Domain 2: Asset Security - understanding data and system ownership and handling.
- Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering - secure patterns and design choices.
- Domain 4: Communication and Network Security - practical secure network design.
- Domain 5: Identity and Access Management - identity patterns across systems.
- Domain 7: Security Operations - monitoring, incident handling and operational security.
- Domain 8: Software Development Security - secure lifecycle and DevSecOps practice.

The mapping remains conceptual rather than exam specific. The purpose is deep understanding and practice, not memorisation.

## Alignment with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0

This level reinforces all NIST CSF 2.0 functions:

- Identify - relating systems, assets, roles and dependencies.
- Protect - selecting and tuning appropriate controls.
- Detect - designing and interpreting monitoring and alerting.
- Respond - walking through simple incident response scenarios.
- Recover - thinking about continuity and learning loops.
- Govern - emphasising roles, responsibilities, policy and assurance.

## Alignment with Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus

Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy connects Cyber Essentials controls to more complex environments. Learners see:

- How the five control themes apply in real architectures.
- How Cyber Essentials Plus style testing and verification might appear in practice.
- How these controls sit alongside broader governance, risk and compliance approaches.

## Accessibility and inclusivity

The Practice and Strategy level continues to focus on accessibility:

- Clear language, with technical terms still explained in place where needed.
- Diagrams with descriptions and text alternatives.
- Tools that remain keyboard accessible and usable on smaller screens.
- Examples that acknowledge different types of organisations and backgrounds.

The tone is still human and encouraging, even when dealing with more serious topics such as incidents and legal obligations.
