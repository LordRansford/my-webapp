# Applied Cybersecurity – course specification

## Overview

**Course name:** Applied Cybersecurity  
**Level:** 2 of 3 in the Cybersecurity Notes course  
**Delivery mode:** Self paced online notes with embedded tools and labs  
**Estimated guided learning hours:** 12  

This level is for people who want to move from “I understand the basics” to “I can think like an attacker and a defender”. It builds directly on Cybersecurity Foundations and makes the learner work with simple models of systems, threats and defences.

## Audience

- Learners who have completed Cybersecurity Foundations or have similar experience.
- IT curious professionals who want to understand how systems fail and how to design safer systems.
- Early career security practitioners who want to consolidate core concepts.
- Teams and classes who need structured, applied exercises for threat modelling, vulnerability thinking and basic incident skills.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of Applied Cybersecurity, learners will be able to:

1. Build simple threat models for small systems by identifying assets, actors, entry points and trust boundaries.
2. Explain how operating systems, networks and services interact and how this creates attack surfaces.
3. Describe common vulnerability classes such as injection, broken authentication, insecure configuration and insecure deserialisation.
4. Explain how authentication, authorisation, sessions and cookies work together in a web application and where they can fail.
5. Read simple logs and alerts and link them back to potential misuse or attacks.
6. Use risk matrices and basic control catalogues to justify security trade offs in realistic scenarios.
7. Relate these skills to recognised frameworks such as CISSP domains, NIST CSF 2.0 functions and Cyber Essentials Plus controls at a high level.

## Module structure

The Applied Cybersecurity content is organised into seven modules on a single page:

1. Module 1: Threat modelling and attacker thinking  
2. Module 2: Networks, operating systems and attack surfaces  
3. Module 3: Vulnerability classes and failure patterns  
4. Module 4: Authentication, sessions and identity in practice  
5. Module 5: Logging, monitoring and detection basics  
6. Module 6: Risk, trade offs and simple decisions  
7. Module 7: Applied checkpoint and labs  

Each module combines explanatory sections with at least one embedded interactive tool and a hands on lab.

## Embedded tools and labs

Examples of tools and labs used at this level include:

- Threat modelling canvas with drag and drop assets, actors and trust boundaries.
- Network and OSI visualiser that shows traffic between simple services.
- Vulnerability playground with safe, sandboxed examples of injection and broken auth.
- Session and cookie flow viewer that shows how identity moves through a basic web app.
- Log viewer and alert simulator for spotting suspicious events.
- Risk and control dashboard where learners practise simple risk decisions.

Each lab has:

- A clear title and objective.
- Step by step instructions.
- Reflection questions that link back to risk, trust and system design.

## Alignment with CISSP domains

Applied Cybersecurity aligns at a deeper level with several CISSP knowledge areas, including:

- Domain 1: Security and Risk Management – practical risk thinking and control choices.
- Domain 2: Asset Security – understanding what needs protection in simple systems.
- Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering – threat modelling and design implications.
- Domain 4: Communication and Network Security – more detailed thinking about network and OSI layers.
- Domain 5: Identity and Access Management – practical session and access control considerations.
- Domain 7: Security Operations – logging, monitoring and basic incident thinking.
- Domain 8: Software Development Security – common vulnerability classes and secure coding basics.

This mapping is conceptual rather than exam specific. The focus remains on understanding and practice.

## Alignment with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0

Applied Cybersecurity emphasises the following NIST CSF 2.0 functions:

- Identify: simple asset and dependency identification within threat models.
- Protect: application of practical security controls across systems and services.
- Detect: basic monitoring and alerting for suspicious behaviour.
- Respond: introductory incident response steps and communication.

The Govern function is introduced through discussion of decision making and trade offs.

## Alignment with Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus

This level deepens understanding and practice of the five Cyber Essentials control themes:

- Firewalls and internet gateways – in the context of network design and attack surfaces.
- Secure configuration – in operating systems, services and applications.
- User access control – more realistic examples of accounts, roles and permissions.
- Malware protection – simple scenarios where poor configuration leads to exposure.
- Patch management – basic examples of outdated software and associated risks.

Cyber Essentials Plus testing concepts are introduced via structured scenarios and labs, without directly simulating official testing.

## Accessibility and inclusivity

The Applied level continues to focus on accessibility and inclusion:

- Short, clear sentences with technical terms explained on first use.
- High contrast text and support for reduced motion.
- Keyboard accessible interactive elements where possible.
- Diagrams with text descriptions and alternative ways to engage with content.

The tone remains human, calm and supportive while gradually increasing the level of challenge.
