# CPD overview (internal)

This document describes the CPD structure and evidence approach for RansfordsNotes.
It is written for assessors and internal reviewers.

## Learning philosophy

- The platform is designed for practitioners who learn best by testing ideas.
- Each course pairs short explanations with interactive labs and checklists.
- The aim is practical competence, not memorisation.

## Course structure

The CPD-trackable courses are:
- Cybersecurity
- AI
- Software Development and Architecture
- Data
- Digitalisation

Each course follows the same progression pattern:
- Foundations (core concepts and shared vocabulary)
- Intermediate (application and workflow thinking)
- Advanced (analysis, judgement, trade offs)
- Summary and games (recap and confidence checks, no new objectives)

## Assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and designed to reinforce recall and interpretation.
- Tools and dashboards provide practice artefacts and structured prompts.
- There is no proctoring and no claim of certification at this stage.

## Evidence tracking approach

Evidence points include:
- time recorded per level (user-entered hours)
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion events (captured as CPD activity entries)
- tool usage signals where applicable

Evidence can be generated as a structured data pack:
- course metadata (hours and objectives)
- learner identifier (email when signed in, otherwise anonymous)
- completion indicators and dates where recorded

## Accessibility considerations

- Keyboard navigation is supported across core pages.
- Focus styles are visible.
- Colour is not the only signal for completion states.
- Diagrams should include text alternatives where practical.

## Update and maintenance policy

- Learning content and tools are version-controlled in the repository.
- Updates should keep course structure stable and changes traceable.
- When estimates or objectives change, the reason should be recorded and reviewed.
