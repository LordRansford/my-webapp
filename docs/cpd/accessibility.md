# CPD accessibility and inclusivity (internal)

This document records accessibility expectations for CPD review readiness.

## Current posture

- The site supports keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
- Content is structured with headings and predictable layout shells.
- Interactive tools aim to avoid reliance on colour alone.

## Checks to perform before submission

- Navigate key pages with keyboard only:
  - Home
  - Course landing pages
  - Tools and dashboards
  - CPD pages
  - Sign in
- Confirm focus order is logical and there are no keyboard traps.
- Confirm skip to content works on Pages Router layouts.
- Confirm text contrast is acceptable for body text and helper text.
- Confirm charts and diagrams have supporting explanatory text.

## Known limitations

- Some diagrams are primarily visual and rely on accompanying text explanation.
- Some labs have dense data views; reviewers should validate readability on small screens.
