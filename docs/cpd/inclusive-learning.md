# Inclusive learning statement (internal)

RansfordsNotes is designed to support learners with different backgrounds and constraints.

## Varied experience levels

- Foundations pages assume minimal prior knowledge.
- Intermediate pages focus on applying concepts in realistic workflows.
- Advanced pages focus on analysis and judgement, with explicit assumptions.

## Self paced learning

- Learners can move between levels without time pressure.
- Notes can be revisited and tools rerun without penalties.

## No assumptions of prior knowledge

- Acronyms are explained when first introduced in a course.
- Glossary tips provide definitions inline.
- Examples aim to be concrete rather than abstract.

## Support for non native speakers

- Short sentences and clear headings are preferred.
- Tools and dashboards use consistent section titles and terminology.
- Complex concepts are introduced with a plain language framing first.
