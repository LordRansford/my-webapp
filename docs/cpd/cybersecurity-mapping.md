# Cybersecurity CPD mapping (internal)

## Levels and estimated hours

- Foundations: 15 hours
- Intermediate (Applied): 12 hours
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy): 14 hours
- Summary and games: present as a recap route; objectives are not expanded here

## Learning objectives (by level)

### Foundations
- Explain the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability) with concrete everyday examples.
- Explain how data representation (bits, bytes, encodings) affects security outcomes.
- Apply simple checks to passwords, links, and basic account hygiene using the labs.
- Analyse a small system to identify trust boundaries and obvious attack surface.
- Demonstrate ability to detect phishing attempts with 90% accuracy.
- Create a personal security improvement plan with evidence of implementation.
- Evaluate breach scenarios and recommend preventive controls.

### Intermediate (Applied)
- Apply basic threat modelling to a small system, identifying assets, actors, and likely threats.
- Explain how authentication, authorisation, sessions, and cookies interact in common web flows.
- Analyse simple log signals and relate them to likely misuse or attack paths.
- Evaluate trade offs between controls when constraints (cost, usability, risk) conflict.

### Advanced (Practice and Strategy)
- Analyse a system design for weak assumptions across identity, secrets, and trust boundaries.
- Evaluate vulnerability and incident information to prioritise remediation and response.
- Explain how governance, logging, and monitoring support detection and recovery in practice.
- Evaluate how to communicate risk and mitigations to non technical stakeholders with clear trade offs.

## Activities and assessments

- Section completion indicators per level
- Formative quizzes embedded in lessons
- Security tools and dashboards used to generate practice artefacts and structured outputs
