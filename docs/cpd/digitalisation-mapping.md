## Levels and estimated hours

- Foundations: 8 hours
- Intermediate: 10 hours
- Advanced: 10 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

## Learning objectives (by level)

### Foundations
- Understand what digitalisation means and how it differs from digitisation and automation.
- Explain how data, processes, and people fit together in a digital operating model.
- Apply basic journey and outcome thinking to a simple service.
- Evaluate common digital trade offs between speed, risk, and reliability.

### Intermediate
- Explain how platforms, APIs, and integration patterns shape digital ecosystems.
- Apply basic schema and contract thinking to a real data sharing scenario.
- Analyse end to end journeys to find friction, duplication, and risk.
- Evaluate trade offs between standardisation and local optimisation.

### Advanced
- Analyse how strategy, governance, and delivery constraints shape digital outcomes.
- Explain how standards, policies, and operating models support sustainable change.
- Evaluate roadmap and risk decisions with a realistic view of dependencies.
- Apply measurement thinking to define outcomes and avoid vanity metrics.

### Summary and games
- Explain key digitalisation concepts and use them in plain language.
- Apply concepts to short scenarios involving journeys, platforms, and change.
- Analyse common failure modes in transformation work and why they happen.
- Evaluate what you would do next to improve outcomes and reduce risk.
