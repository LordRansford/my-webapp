# CPD access policy

CPD relevant learning is intended to remain accessible without payment.

## Guarantee

- Written learning content remains available to visitors.
- CPD tracking, reflection, and progress recording are available to registered learners.
- CPD use is not blocked by donations.

## What requires an account

To keep evidence defensible and tied to a learner identity, CPD tracking and progress recording require a registered learner account.

## What may be restricted by tier

The following may be restricted to support sustainability:
- template downloads
- report exports
- bulk export functions

These restrictions must not remove access to core learning materials or prevent CPD tracking for registered learners.
