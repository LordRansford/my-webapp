# Software Architecture CPD mapping (internal)

## Levels and estimated hours

- Foundations: 10 hours
- Intermediate: 12 hours
- Advanced: 14 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

## Learning objectives (by level)

### Foundations
- Understand core architecture vocabulary (components, boundaries, interfaces) well enough to explain it clearly.
- Explain how architecture decisions relate to reliability, security, and performance.
- Apply simple diagramming and role mapping to make a design discussable.
- Evaluate basic trade offs in a small system design.

### Intermediate
- Explain common architecture styles and integration patterns with clear examples.
- Apply service boundary and data ownership thinking to a realistic scenario.
- Analyse coupling, latency, and consistency trade offs in designs.
- Evaluate design options against non functional needs, not personal preference.

### Advanced
- Analyse architecture decisions in complex systems using realistic constraints and failure modes.
- Explain advanced patterns (events, CQRS, observability) in practical terms.
- Evaluate risk and resilience trade offs and their operational consequences.
- Apply decision recording and governance thinking to keep systems changeable over time.

### Summary and games
- Explain the core architecture ideas from the track in plain language.
- Apply patterns to short scenarios and identify the key trade offs.
- Analyse common failure stories and what design signals were missed.
- Evaluate what you would practise next to improve judgement.

## Activities and assessments

- Section completion indicators for each module
- Formative quizzes embedded in lessons
- Tools and dashboards used to create artefacts (diagrams, checklists, scenarios)
