# AI course evidence snapshot (draft for assessors)

## Course structure

The AI course is structured into four levels:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

The progression is designed to move from vocabulary and core concepts to applied workflows, then to system-level judgement and governance.

## Levels and progression

- Foundations focuses on shared language and basic model behaviour.
- Intermediate focuses on applied workflows, evaluation, and common failure modes.
- Advanced focuses on modern model families, agents, and safe system integration.
- Summary and games provides recap activities that reinforce existing objectives.

## Learning objectives

Learning objectives are defined per level and use action verbs to remain measurable.
Objectives are designed to be auditable and suitable for CPD evidence.

## Activities and tools

- Structured reading sections with checkpoints
- Interactive labs used to test ideas and produce practice artefacts
- Scenario-based exercises and prompts in the summary level

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and reinforce recall and interpretation.
- Quiz completion creates an evidence signal suitable for CPD logs.

## Estimated hours

Hours are conservative estimates to guide learners:
- Foundations: 8
- Intermediate: 10
- Advanced: 12
- Summary and games: 4

## Evidence tracking description

Evidence signals include:
- hours recorded per level via a CPD time tracker
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion events
- tool usage signals where applicable

The platform is designed to support self-directed CPD records and does not claim accreditation unless formally granted and published.

# AI course evidence (submission draft)

## Structure and progression

The AI course is structured as:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

Progression is designed to move from shared vocabulary to applied workflows, then to judgement and governance.

## Learning objectives

### Foundations
- Understand core AI vocabulary (features, labels, training, validation, testing) well enough to explain it clearly.
- Explain how simple models learn patterns from data and where they commonly fail.
- Apply basic checks for leakage, overfitting, and threshold trade offs using the labs.
- Evaluate model outputs with a beginner friendly view of quality, bias, and risk.

### Intermediate
- Apply a basic ML workflow from dataset to evaluation without skipping validation thinking.
- Analyse metric trade offs (precision, recall, F1) and choose a metric that fits the problem.
- Explain how features, training, and deployment constraints shape model behaviour.
- Evaluate common failure modes such as drift, bias, and leakage using practical checks.

### Advanced
- Explain how transformers, generative models, and agent patterns work at a system level.
- Analyse where advanced models fail (hallucination, misuse, brittleness) and what signals reveal it.
- Evaluate governance and safety controls that reduce real operational risk.
- Apply a basic deployment and monitoring mindset to advanced AI features.

### Summary and games
- Explain key concepts from the track in plain language without copying definitions.
- Apply concepts to short scenarios and identify what matters most.
- Analyse mistakes and misconceptions surfaced by the games and quizzes.
- Evaluate what you would do next to strengthen weak areas.

## Activities and tools

Activities include:
- interactive labs embedded within levels
- dashboards and small exercises that produce structured outputs
- guided prompts encouraging prediction and reflection

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and embedded within levels.
- Completion is recorded as part of learning activity signals.

## Estimated hours

- Foundations: 8 hours
- Intermediate: 10 hours
- Advanced: 12 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

These estimates are conservative and intended as guidance for self-directed CPD logging.

## Evidence tracking

Evidence points include:
- recorded hours per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion signals
- tool usage signals where applicable
