# Software Architecture course evidence snapshot (draft for assessors)

## Course structure

The Software Architecture course is structured into four levels:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

The progression is designed to move from core vocabulary and simple diagrams to applied patterns, then to analysis and judgement in complex systems.

## Levels and progression

- Foundations focuses on core concepts, responsibilities, and readable architecture thinking.
- Intermediate focuses on common styles, integration patterns, and defendable trade offs.
- Advanced focuses on complex system constraints, resilience, governance, and operational consequences.
- Summary and games provides recap activities that reinforce existing objectives.

## Learning objectives

Objectives are defined per level and use action verbs to remain measurable and auditable.

## Activities and tools

- Structured reading sections with completion indicators
- Tools that produce design artefacts (diagrams, checklists, prompts)
- Scenario-based exercises and recap activities

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and reinforce interpretation.
- Completion signals are suitable as evidence points in a CPD log.

## Estimated hours

Hours are conservative estimates to guide learners:
- Foundations: 10
- Intermediate: 12
- Advanced: 14
- Summary and games: 4

## Evidence tracking description

Evidence signals include:
- hours recorded per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion events
- tool usage signals where applicable

The platform supports self-directed CPD evidence and does not claim accreditation unless formally granted and published.

# Software Architecture course evidence (submission draft)

## Structure and progression

The Software Development and Architecture course is structured as:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

Progression moves from shared vocabulary to applied design choices, then to analysis and judgement for complex systems.

## Learning objectives

### Foundations
- Understand core architecture vocabulary (components, boundaries, interfaces) well enough to explain it clearly.
- Explain how architecture decisions relate to reliability, security, and performance.
- Apply simple diagramming and role mapping to make a design discussable.
- Evaluate basic trade offs in a small system design.

### Intermediate
- Explain common architecture styles and integration patterns with clear examples.
- Apply service boundary and data ownership thinking to a realistic scenario.
- Analyse coupling, latency, and consistency trade offs in designs.
- Evaluate design options against non functional needs, not personal preference.

### Advanced
- Analyse architecture decisions in complex systems using realistic constraints and failure modes.
- Explain advanced patterns (events, CQRS, observability) in practical terms.
- Evaluate risk and resilience trade offs and their operational consequences.
- Apply decision recording and governance thinking to keep systems changeable over time.

### Summary and games
- Explain the core architecture ideas from the track in plain language.
- Apply patterns to short scenarios and identify the key trade offs.
- Analyse common failure stories and what design signals were missed.
- Evaluate what you would practise next to improve judgement.

## Activities and tools

Activities include:
- interactive tools for modelling boundaries, trade offs, and architecture decisions
- dashboards for scenario exploration and structured thinking
- artefact creation through templates and checklists

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and embedded within levels.
- Completion is recorded as part of learning activity signals.

## Estimated hours

- Foundations: 10 hours
- Intermediate: 12 hours
- Advanced: 14 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

These estimates are conservative and intended as guidance for self-directed CPD logging.

## Evidence tracking

Evidence points include:
- recorded hours per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion signals
- tool usage signals where applicable
