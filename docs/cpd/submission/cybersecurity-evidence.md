# Cybersecurity course evidence snapshot (draft for assessors)

## Course structure

The Cybersecurity course is structured into:
- Foundations
- Intermediate (Applied)
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy)
- Summary and games (recap route)

The progression is designed to move from shared vocabulary and everyday security habits to applied system thinking and defendable trade offs.

## Levels and progression

- Foundations covers core concepts, basic threats, and everyday defences with hands-on labs.
- Intermediate (Applied) covers threat modelling, attack surfaces, web auth flows, logs, and risk trade offs.
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy) covers secure design judgement, detection and response, and governance basics.
- Summary and games provides recap activities that reinforce existing objectives.

## Learning objectives

Objectives are defined per level and use action verbs to remain measurable.
They are suitable for CPD evidence as self-directed learning outcomes.

## Activities and tools

- Structured learning sections with completion indicators
- In-browser labs that produce practice artefacts (examples, checklists, structured outputs)
- Dashboards that support scenario exploration and interpretation

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and designed to reinforce understanding and interpretation.
- Quiz completion creates an evidence signal suitable for CPD logs.

## Estimated hours

Hours are conservative estimates to guide learners:
- Foundations: 15
- Intermediate (Applied): 12
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy): 14

## Evidence tracking description

Evidence signals include:
- hours recorded per level via a CPD time tracker
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion events
- tool usage signals where applicable

The platform is designed to support self-directed CPD evidence and does not claim accreditation unless formally granted and published.

# Cybersecurity course evidence (submission draft)

## Structure and progression

The Cybersecurity course is structured as:
- Foundations
- Intermediate (Applied)
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy)
- Summary and games (recap route)

Progression moves from everyday security habits and vocabulary to applied modelling and web flows, then to judgement, governance, and incident thinking.

## Learning objectives

### Foundations
- Explain the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability) with concrete everyday examples.
- Explain how data representation (bits, bytes, encodings) affects security outcomes.
- Apply simple checks to passwords, links, and basic account hygiene using the labs.
- Analyse a small system to identify trust boundaries and obvious attack surface.

### Intermediate (Applied)
- Apply basic threat modelling to a small system, identifying assets, actors, and likely threats.
- Explain how authentication, authorisation, sessions, and cookies interact in common web flows.
- Analyse simple log signals and relate them to likely misuse or attack paths.
- Evaluate trade offs between controls when constraints (cost, usability, risk) conflict.

### Advanced (Practice and Strategy)
- Analyse a system design for weak assumptions across identity, secrets, and trust boundaries.
- Evaluate vulnerability and incident information to prioritise remediation and response.
- Explain how governance, logging, and monitoring support detection and recovery in practice.
- Evaluate how to communicate risk and mitigations to non technical stakeholders with clear trade offs.

## Activities and tools

Activities include:
- interactive labs embedded in lesson pages
- dashboards exploring scenarios and trade offs
- structured tools that produce artefacts (risk notes, header interpretations, URL analysis)

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and embedded within levels.
- Completion is recorded as part of learning activity signals.

## Estimated hours

- Foundations: 15 hours
- Intermediate (Applied): 12 hours
- Advanced (Practice and Strategy): 14 hours

These estimates are conservative and intended as guidance for self-directed CPD logging.

## Evidence tracking

Evidence points include:
- recorded hours per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion signals
- tool usage signals where applicable
