# Digitalisation course evidence snapshot (draft for assessors)

## Course structure

The Digitalisation course is structured into four levels:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

The progression is designed to move from clear definitions and shared vocabulary to applied platform thinking, then to strategy and governance judgement.

## Levels and progression

- Foundations focuses on what digitalisation is, and how data, people, and processes connect.
- Intermediate focuses on platforms, APIs, integration, and real workflow constraints.
- Advanced focuses on governance, roadmaps, risk, and outcome measurement.
- Summary and games provides recap activities that reinforce existing objectives.

## Learning objectives

Objectives are defined per level and use measurable action verbs.

## Activities and tools

- Structured reading sections with completion indicators
- Tools and dashboards used for scenario exploration and structured outputs
- Recap activities designed to reinforce existing objectives

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and reinforce interpretation.
- Completion signals are suitable as evidence points in a CPD log.

## Estimated hours

Hours are conservative estimates to guide learners:
- Foundations: 8
- Intermediate: 10
- Advanced: 10
- Summary and games: 4

## Evidence tracking description

Evidence signals include:
- hours recorded per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion events
- tool usage signals where applicable

The platform supports self-directed CPD evidence and does not claim accreditation unless formally granted and published.

# Digitalisation course evidence (submission draft)

## Structure and progression

The Digitalisation course is structured as:
- Foundations
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Summary and games

Progression moves from shared language to applied platforms and journeys, then to analysis of strategy and governance.

## Learning objectives

### Foundations
- Understand what digitalisation means and how it differs from digitisation and automation.
- Explain how data, processes, and people fit together in a digital operating model.
- Apply basic journey and outcome thinking to a simple service.
- Evaluate common digital trade offs between speed, risk, and reliability.

### Intermediate
- Explain how platforms, APIs, and integration patterns shape digital ecosystems.
- Apply basic schema and contract thinking to a real data sharing scenario.
- Analyse end to end journeys to find friction, duplication, and risk.
- Evaluate trade offs between standardisation and local optimisation.

### Advanced
- Analyse how strategy, governance, and delivery constraints shape digital outcomes.
- Explain how standards, policies, and operating models support sustainable change.
- Evaluate roadmap and risk decisions with a realistic view of dependencies.
- Apply measurement thinking to define outcomes and avoid vanity metrics.

### Summary and games
- Explain key digitalisation concepts and use them in plain language.
- Apply concepts to short scenarios involving journeys, platforms, and change.
- Analyse common failure modes in transformation work and why they happen.
- Evaluate what you would do next to improve outcomes and reduce risk.

## Activities and tools

Activities include:
- tools and dashboards for modelling journeys, data flows, and operating choices
- templates that produce structured artefacts for planning and review
- quizzes embedded in levels

## Quizzes and assessment approach

- Quizzes are formative and embedded within levels.
- Completion is recorded as part of learning activity signals.

## Estimated hours

- Foundations: 8 hours
- Intermediate: 10 hours
- Advanced: 10 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

These estimates are conservative and intended as guidance for self-directed CPD logging.

## Evidence tracking

Evidence points include:
- recorded hours per level
- section completion indicators
- quiz completion signals
- tool usage signals where applicable
