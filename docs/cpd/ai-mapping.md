# AI CPD mapping (internal)

## Levels and estimated hours

- Foundations: 8 hours
- Intermediate: 10 hours
- Advanced: 12 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

## Learning objectives (by level)

### Foundations
- Understand core AI vocabulary (features, labels, training, validation, testing) well enough to explain it clearly.
- Explain how simple models learn patterns from data and where they commonly fail.
- Apply basic checks for leakage, overfitting, and threshold trade offs using the labs.
- Evaluate model outputs with a beginner friendly view of quality, bias, and risk.

### Intermediate
- Apply a basic ML workflow from dataset to evaluation without skipping validation thinking.
- Analyse metric trade offs (precision, recall, F1) and choose a metric that fits the problem.
- Explain how features, training, and deployment constraints shape model behaviour.
- Evaluate common failure modes such as drift, bias, and leakage using practical checks.

### Advanced
- Explain how transformers, generative models, and agent patterns work at a system level.
- Analyse where advanced models fail (hallucination, misuse, brittleness) and what signals reveal it.
- Evaluate governance and safety controls that reduce real operational risk.
- Apply a basic deployment and monitoring mindset to advanced AI features.

### Summary and games
- Explain key concepts from the track in plain language without copying definitions.
- Apply concepts to short scenarios and identify what matters most.
- Analyse mistakes and misconceptions surfaced by the games and quizzes.
- Evaluate what you would do next to strengthen weak areas.

## Activities and assessments

- Section completion indicators for core modules
- Quizzes embedded in lessons (formative)
- Interactive tools and labs embedded in levels and summary
