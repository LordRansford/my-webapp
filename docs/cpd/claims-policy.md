# CPD claims policy (internal)

This policy defines wording that is allowed and disallowed when describing CPD, accreditation, and endorsements.
It is written to avoid implied approval or misleading claims.

## Allowed wording

- "Designed to support self-directed CPD"
- "Suitable for CPD evidence alongside your own notes and employer policy"
- "Aligned with" (when describing frameworks as learning references)
- "Submission preparation" or "submission in progress" (when a submission has not been approved)
- "No accreditation is claimed" or "No endorsement is implied"

## Disallowed wording

- "Accredited", "endorsed", "approved", "certified" (unless you can provide a public, verifiable statement)
- "Guaranteed CPD", "guaranteed hours", "guaranteed acceptance"
- "Official training provider" (unless formally appointed)
- "Exam pass guarantee" or any implication of guaranteed outcomes

## CPD status statement template (safe)

Use a short statement like:

"This platform is designed to support self-directed CPD with clear objectives, conservative hour estimates, and evidence-friendly outputs. No external accreditation or endorsement is claimed unless explicitly stated with supporting documentation."

- Keep disclaimers short and readable. Do not hide them.
