# Data CPD mapping (internal)

## Levels and estimated hours

- Foundations: 8 hours
- Intermediate: 10 hours
- Advanced: 12 hours
- Summary and games: 4 hours

## Learning objectives (by level)

### Foundations
- Understand what data is, how it moves, and why teams misinterpret it.
- Explain common formats and basic storage and querying choices.
- Apply simple quality and stewardship checks to a dataset and a workflow.
- Evaluate basic responsible data risks and trade offs.

### Intermediate
- Explain how schemas and interfaces support real questions and constraints.
- Apply a simple pipeline model from ingestion to serving and identify failure points.
- Analyse trust signals (tests, monitoring, lineage) that make data usable in production.
- Evaluate trade offs between speed, quality, and governance constraints.

### Advanced
- Analyse distribution, sampling, and measurement issues that distort conclusions.
- Explain how advanced system choices (streaming, storage, governance) change data quality and latency.
- Evaluate architectural trade offs for warehouse, lakehouse, and hybrid approaches.
- Apply governance and strategy thinking to keep data ownership and interfaces clear.

### Summary and games
- Explain core data concepts from the track with clear examples.
- Apply concepts to short scenarios and identify what to measure and why.
- Analyse common mistakes and misreads that show up in real data work.
- Evaluate what you would change in a workflow to improve trust and outcomes.

## Activities and assessments

- Section completion indicators per module
- Formative quizzes embedded in lessons
- Tools and dashboards used to generate practice artefacts and structured thinking prompts
