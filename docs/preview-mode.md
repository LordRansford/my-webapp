# Preview mode (internal)

Some internal pages are protected by a lightweight preview gate to reduce accidental sharing during early release.

## Enable preview mode locally

Either:

- Set an environment variable:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE=true`

Or:

- Add a query parameter:
  - `?preview=true`

## Default

Recommended default for non-preview usage:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE=false`
