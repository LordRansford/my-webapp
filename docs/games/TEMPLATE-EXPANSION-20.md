## 🔧 Template Quality

### All Templates Include:
- ✅ Unique IDs
- ✅ Appropriate difficulty ratings
- ✅ Clear question templates
- ✅ Explanatory answers
- ✅ Proper generation logic
- ✅ Valid answer options

### Pattern Templates:
- ✅ Correct sequence generation
- ✅ Proper RNG integration
- ✅ Valid wrong answer generation
- ✅ Sequence-based explanations

### Logic Templates:

## ⚠️ Note on Deduction & Constraint Types

The puzzle generator still supports 4 types: `logic`, `pattern`, `deduction`, and `constraint`.

Currently:
- ✅ **Logic**: 10 templates (fully supported)
- ✅ **Pattern**: 10 templates (fully supported)
- ⚠️ **Deduction**: Uses fallback puzzle (can be added later)
- ⚠️ **Constraint**: Uses fallback puzzle (can be added later)

This is acceptable because:
1. The game weights types based on tier (novice gets mostly logic/pattern)
2. Fallback puzzles provide basic functionality
3. Deduction/constraint templates can be added in future updates when needed

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Templates expanded to 20 (complete)
- Test puzzle generation with new templates
- Verify variety in generated puzzles
- Check difficulty distribution

### Future Enhancements
1. Add deduction puzzle templates (5-10 templates)
2. Add constraint puzzle templates (5-10 templates)
3. Add more advanced logic patterns
4. Add more complex sequence patterns
5. Procedural generation for infinite variety
6. Template difficulty refinement based on analytics
