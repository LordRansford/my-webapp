# Certification alignment reference map

This file is a reference map to help content upgrades align to recognised frameworks. It is not a marketing claim and it is not a promise of certification outcomes.

## CISSP (domain level)

- **Domain 1: Security and Risk Management**: governance, risk, compliance, policy, ethics, organisational context
- **Domain 2: Asset Security**: data classification, ownership, handling, retention, privacy principles
- **Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering**: secure design principles, crypto concepts, trusted computing basics
- **Domain 4: Communication and Network Security**: network models, segmentation, protocols, secure communication
- **Domain 5: Identity and Access Management**: authentication, authorisation, MFA, least privilege, lifecycle
- **Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing**: testing intent, evidence, metrics, validation of controls
- **Domain 7: Security Operations**: logging, monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management, continuity
- **Domain 8: Software Development Security**: secure SDLC, threat modelling, code risks, supply chain

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (function level)

- **Govern**: roles, responsibilities, strategy, policy, risk oversight
- **Identify**: assets, business context, risk assessment, dependencies
- **Protect**: access control, awareness, data security, maintenance, protective tech
- **Detect**: logging, monitoring, anomalies, detection processes
- **Respond**: incident response, communications, analysis, mitigation
- **Recover**: recovery planning, improvements, communications

## Cyber Essentials Plus (control theme level)

- **Boundary firewalls and internet gateways**: segmentation, inbound and outbound control
- **Secure configuration**: hardening, defaults, patch baselines
- **Access control**: least privilege, account management, MFA where appropriate
- **Malware protection**: prevention and detection posture
- **Patch management**: update cadence, risk based prioritisation, coverage

## DAMA DMBOK (knowledge area level)

- **Data governance**: decision rights, stewardship, policy, accountability
- **Data management**: operating model, roles, processes
- **Data quality**: measurement, improvement loops, root cause analysis
- **Data architecture**: models, flows, lineage, ownership boundaries
- **Metadata management**: definitions, catalogues, discoverability
- **Data security**: classification, access control, privacy principles

## TOGAF (conceptual level)

- **Architecture as decision making**: principles, constraints, trade offs
- **ADM lifecycle idea**: iterate from current state to target state with governance
- **Capability based planning**: build reusable capabilities rather than one off projects

## SABSA (conceptual level)

- **Business driven security**: security requirements derived from business needs
- **Traceability**: link risk, controls, and evidence back to goals
- **Layered thinking**: context, conceptual, logical, physical, and operational views
