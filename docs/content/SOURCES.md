# Sources and accuracy guardrails

This file defines what counts as a reputable source in this repo and how to use sources responsibly.

## Allowed sources

Prefer primary sources and established institutions:

- **NIST** publications and frameworks
- **ISO/IEC** standards (refer by standard name and scope)
- **OWASP** guides (Top 10, ASVS, Cheat Sheets)
- **Academic institutions** and peer reviewed papers
- **Government cyber agencies** (for example NCSC guidance)
- **Major textbooks** and recognised professional bodies where relevant

## Not allowed

- Blog posts with unknown authorship or unclear review
- Social media threads as evidence
- Vendor marketing as a primary reference
- Claims that depend on private or unverifiable data

## Rules for claims

- Treat descriptive claims and normative advice differently.
  - Descriptive: what is observed in practice
  - Normative: what you should do
- If a claim is likely to be challenged, support it with a reputable reference or phrase it as a careful observation.
- Do not make future promises phrased as fact.
- Do not imply accreditation or certification outcomes.

## Rules for examples

- No PII.
- No real organisation naming.
- Keep examples realistic and non sensational.
- If you mention a standard, do not overstate what it guarantees.

## Rules for frameworks

- Use frameworks as maps, not as magic.
- Avoid implying compliance equals security.
- When mapping content to a framework, explain the intent and limits.
