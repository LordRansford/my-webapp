# Content upgrade checklist

Use this checklist when upgrading any course page. This is a process guard so upgrades stay deep and consistent.

## Structure and learning components

- **Glossary coverage**: key terms have GlossaryTip on first use
- **Diagrams present**: at least one DiagramBlock where it improves understanding
- **Tool present**: at least one ToolCard that is visible and functional or intentionally stubbed
- **Quiz present**: at least one QuizBlock that tests reasoning, not recall only

## Depth and credibility

- **Real world scenario**: one scenario that mirrors professional work
- **Common misconceptions**: a section or callout that corrects a common misunderstanding
- **What professionals get wrong**: one short section explaining failure patterns in practice
- **Trade offs**: explicit trade offs using:
  - What this optimises for
  - What this makes harder

## Writing and accessibility

- **Short paragraphs**: avoid long dense blocks
- **Define before abstracting**: introduce terms before using them
- **Acronyms expanded**: first use expands acronyms
- **No assumed knowledge**: include the missing step when a beginner would get lost
- **No em dash in client facing text**

## Safety and accuracy

- **No speculative claims**: if you cannot justify it, do not say it as fact
- **Sources aligned**: major claims align to reputable references (see `SOURCES.md`)
- **No vendor marketing**: content stays neutral and evidence based
