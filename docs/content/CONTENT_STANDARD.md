# Content standard (Ransford's Notes)

This document defines the writing and structure rules for course content in this repo. It exists so upgrades stay consistent, deep, and assessable.

## Tone rules

- Write in a personal voice. Use "I" sparingly but naturally.
- Sound calm, precise, and practical.
- Light humour is allowed when it helps learning, not when it undermines credibility.
- Avoid hype, fear, or marketing language.
- Do not use em dash in any client facing text.

## Paragraph length rules

- Prefer short paragraphs (2 to 4 sentences).
- Break up dense ideas into steps.
- Use headings to reset attention and create scan points.

## Explanation rules

- Define before abstracting.
- Introduce unfamiliar words the first time they appear.
- Prefer clear language over jargon. If jargon is needed, explain it once and reuse it consistently.
- Always answer:
  - What is it
  - Why it exists
  - What breaks if it is ignored
  - What trade off is being made

## Examples rules

- Use real world scenarios where possible (incidents, workflows, policies, constraints).
- Avoid unrealistic strawman examples.
- Prefer examples that mirror how professionals actually work: incomplete information, deadlines, and competing priorities.
- If an example could be misread as a claim about a real organisation, rewrite it to be generic and non identifying.

## Maths and formulas rules

- Use math only when it adds clarity.
- Render formulas using math blocks and explain each term in plain language.
- Provide intuition before notation.
- Avoid giving formulas without explaining what they mean and how to use them.

## Accessibility rules

- Assume no prior knowledge unless the page explicitly states prerequisites.
- Expand acronyms on first use.
- Avoid dense blocks of text.
- Prefer concrete verbs over abstract nouns.
- Do not rely on colour alone to convey meaning.
- Ensure diagrams and callouts have enough surrounding explanation to be understood without visuals.

## Depth checklist for each major section

Each major section should include:

- A clear definition and context
- A practical example or scenario
- A common misconception
- A "what professionals get wrong" note
- One diagram where a diagram clarifies reasoning
- One tool or exercise where practice clarifies judgement
- One quiz or check for understanding
