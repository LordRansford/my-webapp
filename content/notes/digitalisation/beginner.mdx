# Digitalisation Strategy Notes - Beginner

<LevelProgressBar courseId="digitalisation" levelId="foundations" sectionIds={digitalisationSectionManifest.foundations} />

<BodyText>
  These notes are calm and honest. Digitalisation is not magic. It is the deliberate redesign of how an organisation creates value using digital technology, data, and new ways of working. The focus here is value, not tools, and people, not buzzwords.

Digitalisation is the deliberate redesign of how an organisation creates value using digital technology, data, and new ways of working.
</Callout>

Digitalisation is about value, how work is done, people and processes, and decisions about problems, capabilities, data use, protection, and ways of working. The rest of this page builds that picture step by step.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="💡" id="why-digitalisation-matters">
  Why digitalisation matters
</SectionHeader>

Digitalisation matters because expectations are higher, complexity is greater, and competition and scrutiny are sharper. People compare every service to the best digital products they use daily. Manual processes cannot keep up with data, regulation, and risk.

<Callout variant="concept">
If your core services cannot be delivered reliably, securely, and simply through digital channels, you have a digitalisation problem.
</Callout>

Digitalisation is not a one time project. It is an ongoing capability if an organisation wants to stay useful and trusted.

  Digitisation vs digitalisation vs digital transformation
</SectionHeader>

<GlossaryTip term="Digitisation">
Plain language. Converting analogue information into digital form, such as scanning paper into PDF.  
Formal wording. Transforming analogue artefacts into digital representations without altering the underlying process.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="Digitalisation">
Plain language. Changing how work is done using digital tools and data.  
Formal wording. Redesigning processes, controls, and user experience with digital capabilities at the core.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="Digital transformation">
Plain language. Reshaping how an organisation operates and creates value with digital at the centre.  
Formal wording. Strategic reconfiguration of business models, operating models, and services enabled by digital capabilities.
</GlossaryTip>

Digitisation without digitalisation gives the worst of both worlds. Digitalisation without transformation improves efficiency but rarely changes outcomes. These notes focus on digitalisation because that is where strategy meets architecture, data, people, and change.

  Data as a strategic asset
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="digitalisation" levelId="foundations" sectionId="dig-foundations-data-and-processes" />

Data becomes an asset when it is correct enough to trust, accessible enough to use, governed enough to protect, and connected enough to create insight. Treating data strategically means deciding who is responsible, how it is collected, stored, shared, measured, and used safely.

<Callout variant="concept">
Digitalisation without data discipline is automation of confusion.

  People and culture
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="digitalisation" levelId="foundations" sectionId="dig-foundations-people-and-change" />

Culture is the hard part. Systems succeed only when people trust them, know how to use them, and are supported to change habits. A digital culture shows up in the questions people ask: do we use data to decide, do we share information, do we test ideas, do we treat security and privacy as design constraints.

<GlossaryTip term="Digital culture">
Plain language. Shared behaviours that support using digital tools and data to improve outcomes.  
Formal wording. Collective attitudes, norms, and practices that enable adoption of digital capabilities and continuous improvement.
</GlossaryTip>

<Callout variant="concept">
If you automate a broken process, you get a faster broken process.
</Callout>

Start with process. Understand real steps, delays, and bottlenecks. Decide which steps add value. Then choose technology. Cloud platforms, integration, identity and access, observability. Technology supports better processes. It does not replace thinking.

  Planning and maturity

Digitalisation is a journey in three horizons. Short term visible wins, medium term shared platforms and data foundations, long term operating model change. Maturity models help if used to decide realistic next steps, not to chase a score.

<GlossaryTip term="Digital maturity">
Plain language. How far an organisation has progressed in using digital tools, data, and ways of working.  
Formal wording. A staged description of capability and adoption of digital practices relative to desired outcomes.
</GlossaryTip>

  Observing digitalisation in practice

Digitalisation must be observable. It should show up in usage of digital channels, time saved, platform adoption, and indicators of data quality. Measuring change is part of doing digitalisation well.
