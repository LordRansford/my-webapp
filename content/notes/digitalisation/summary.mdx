# Digitalisation Strategy Notes - Summary

This page consolidates the beginner, intermediate, and advanced digitalisation notes. It is lighter in tone but still serious. The aim is to test understanding, make decisions, and read signals like a digital leader.

## What you should now understand

If you have worked through the previous pages, you should be able to explain:

- What digitalisation is and how it differs from digitisation and digital transformation
- Why data, people, process, and technology all matter together
- How outcomes, operating models, and capabilities turn into a strategy
- How platforms, architecture, and governance support or constrain that strategy
- Why ecosystems, regulation, and trust shape what is possible at scale

<Callout variant="concept">
If you can describe digitalisation without naming a vendor or product, you have understood the idea, not just the tools.

## Dashboards and signals

Digitalisation should be visible and measurable. Use the dashboard below as a thinking tool. Ask what would worry you, what evidence you would need for decisions, and which trends show healthy or risky digitalisation.

<DigitalisationDashboard />

<GlossaryTip term="Signal">
Plain: A piece of information that helps you understand the health and direction of a digital system or strategy.  
Formal: An indicator derived from operations or outcomes that informs assessment of digital performance and risk.
</GlossaryTip>

## Mini strategy sprint

Use this as a guided exercise. Pick a context (utility, government department, health service, local council, medium private company) and answer:

1. What problem or opportunity would you focus on first  
2. What outcomes would you use to judge success after one year  
3. Which two or three capabilities are weakest and need strengthening  
4. Which shared platforms or data foundations would you prioritise  
5. What governance or funding changes would you need  
6. Which partners or regulators would you involve early  
7. What goes on a simple three year roadmap so year one does not depend on year three being perfect  

<Callout variant="concept">
If you can write this down clearly once, you can adapt it and repeat for many contexts.

## Reflection and next steps

<QuizBlock
  questions={[
    {
      q: "What is the most important difference between digitalisation and buying new technology?",
      a: "Digitalisation changes how value is created through people, processes, data, and technology together, not just acquiring tools."
    },
    {
      q: "Why does thinking in ecosystems matter at the advanced level?",
      a: "Because services, data, and risks span many organisations, so decisions in one place can help or harm many others."
    },
    {
      q: "What makes a digitalisation roadmap credible rather than aspirational?",
      a: "It respects maturity and dependencies, aligns with funding and capacity, and ties to clear outcomes and signals."
    },
    {
      q: "How do games and dashboards help deepen understanding rather than distract?",
      a: "They force explicit choices, reveal consequences, and build the habit of reading patterns, which strengthens the mental model from the notes."
    }
