# BookTrack capstone journey

This is where everything joins up.

BookTrack is our running example for a modern organisation that sells books, runs events and wants to use data and AI without breaking the law, the cloud bill or the trust of its customers.

This journey walks through:

- Software architecture  
- Cybersecurity  
- Digitalisation strategy  
- AI and data science  

The goal is not to build a perfect system. The goal is to think like a responsible engineer from idea to operations.

> Tip: treat this like a lab, not an exam. Make decisions, write them down and change your mind when you learn something new.

---

## 1. Frame BookTrack as a system (Architecture)

Open the **Software architecture notes and dashboards**.

1. In the beginner and intermediate notes, skim the core ideas again: layers, components, domain models, coupling, cohesion.
2. In the **System landscape canvas** dashboard, sketch BookTrack:
   - Web app or apps  
   - API gateway or backend  
   - User service, catalogue, orders, payments, search, notifications  
3. Use the **Domain model sandbox** to capture the key entities:
   - Customer, Book, Order, Payment, Event, Recommendation
4. Add at least three decisions in the **Architecture decision log**:
   - One about data storage  
   - One about integration style (for example synchronous calls versus messaging)  
   - One about scale or resilience

Write your decisions as if someone else will have to live with them.

> Reflection: If BookTrack disappeared for one hour, what part of your design would you blame first and how could you make that part easier to fix?

## 2. Make security a first class concern (Cybersecurity)

Open the **Cybersecurity notes, dashboards and useful tools**.

1. In the threat modelling section, treat BookTrack as the target.
   - Identify assets: customer accounts, payment details, order history, recommendation data.
   - Identify actors: customers, staff, partners, attackers, bots.
2. Use the **Risk matrix builder** dashboard to capture three real risks.
   - At least one should be about account takeover.
   - At least one should be about data leakage from logs, backups or analytics.
3. Use the **Access control matrix** and **Data classification** dashboards to line up:
   - Which roles can see which data  
   - Which data needs the strongest protection
4. In the **Useful tools** section:
   - Run the password, header and URL checks on realistic examples from BookTrack.
   - Note anything that would make you nervous if this was a real company.

Connect this back to architecture:

- Do any components need to be split or isolated to reduce blast radius  
- Do any APIs need stronger auth or rate limiting  

> Reflection: Imagine a security incident post mortem for BookTrack. What is the single sentence you want the report to say about your preparation?

## 3. Treat digitalisation as a strategy, not just IT

Open the **Digitalisation notes, dashboards and summary**.

Think of BookTrack as part of a wider organisation, not just an app.

1. In the beginner and intermediate digitalisation notes:
   - Map BookTrack to business outcomes: revenue, customer loyalty, regulatory compliance, staff productivity.
2. Use the **Digitalisation dashboards**:
   - Scenario and roadmap tools to plan a three step digitalisation journey for BookTrack.
   - Risk and benefit views to decide what to do first and what to postpone.
3. Fill in a lightweight **digitalisation canvas** for BookTrack:
   - Vision: what changes for customers and staff  
   - Capabilities: data, platforms, skills that are needed  
   - Constraints: regulation, budgets, legacy systems

Link this back to security and architecture:

- Which digitalisation moves increase cyber risk and need stronger controls  
- Which moves unlock better observability, automation or resilience  

> Reflection: If BookTrack had to justify its digital investments to a board, which three numbers and which three stories would you show first?

## 4. Build and test intelligence responsibly (AI and data)

Open the **AI notes, dashboards, labs and Ransford’s AI Studios**.

Treat BookTrack as a data and AI product, not just a website.

1. From the AI notes:
   - Pick one supervised learning use case, for example churn prediction, recommendation ranking or fraud detection.
   - Pick one generative or LLM use case, for example support assistant or content tagging.
2. In **Ransford’s AI Studios**:
   - Use the **Model Forge** or tabular lab to train a small model on the sample churn dataset.
   - Walk through dataset selection, target definition, metric selection and basic training.
   - Inspect precision, recall, F1 and confusion matrix and decide whether this model is safe to use even as a demo.
3. In the **LLM and Agent labs**:
   - Design a small agent for BookTrack: for example a support bot that can answer order questions using documentation.
   - Write down its allowed tools, context, and hard safety limits.
4. In the AI notes and dashboards:
   - Use the bias, fairness and monitoring tools to think about drift, bad data and abuse.

Tie this back to earlier work:

- Where do models sit in your architecture  
- How are they deployed, monitored and retrained  
- How do you prevent them from undermining your security and digitalisation goals  

> Reflection: If an AI model made a harmful decision in BookTrack, how would you detect it and what evidence would you have to explain what happened?

## 5. Ship BookTrack safely (Software development and dev studios)

Open **Ransford’s Software Development Studio**.

Now you connect everything and behave like a team preparing for a real release.

1. In the dev studio **Architecture lab**:
   - Align the BookTrack structure and decisions with what you have already written in the architecture course.
2. In the **Backend and API lab**:
   - Shape API behaviour, errors and rate limits in a way that respects your cybersecurity work.
3. In the **Frontend lab**:
   - Make sure user flows for login, orders and AI powered features handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
4. In the **Delivery and Ops lab**:
   - Design a pipeline for BookTrack with at least:
     - Source control and branching strategy  
     - Automated tests including security and performance checks  
     - Staging and production environments  
     - Rollback or canary plan

Keep an eye on the safety banner and upload limits when you play with real files. This is still a teaching studio, not a production cloud.

> Reflection: What parts of this pipeline are you already doing in your real work, and which parts would give you the biggest benefit if you started next month?

## 6. Capture evidence and next steps

The capstone is most useful when it produces artefacts you can show.

By the end of this journey you should have:

- A system landscape sketch and domain model for BookTrack  
- A small set of architecture decisions  
- A risk register and access view from the cybersecurity tools  
- A digitalisation narrative with a simple roadmap  
- At least one trained model with metrics and a short written judgement about fitness for purpose  
- A pipeline outline showing how you would build and deploy BookTrack

You can keep this as a private learning portfolio or adapt the pattern for your real organisation.

> Final reflection: If you repeated this journey in six months, what would you expect to change first – the technology, the controls, or your judgement?
