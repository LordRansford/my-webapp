  In foundations we built language and the basic flow. Here we get more exact about behaviour.
  We focus on what you can prove using inspection, not what you can recite.

  TCP reliability and flow
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-tcp-reliability-and-flow" />

TCP provides a reliable byte stream between two endpoints.
Reliable means three specific things.

1. Data is delivered in order.
2. Data is retransmitted if it is lost.
3. Data is protected against corruption using checksums.

TCP also manages flow control so a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver.
It also performs congestion control so the network is not overwhelmed.

  UDP and real world trade offs
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-udp-and-real-world-trade-offs" />

UDP is a connectionless transport.
It sends datagrams. It does not provide ordering or retransmission.

This is not always a weakness.
Some applications implement reliability themselves.
Some applications prefer timeliness over perfect delivery.

Examples you will see often:

1. DNS commonly uses UDP for queries.
2. Real time audio and video often uses UDP based transports.
3. Modern web transports can run over UDP based protocols such as QUIC.

  Routing and forwarding
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-routing-and-forwarding" />

Routing is how a device decides which next hop to use for a destination.
Forwarding is the act of moving a packet from one interface to another based on that decision.

Switching is different.
A switch forwards frames inside a local network using MAC addresses.
A router forwards packets across networks using IP addresses.

This is why you can have a perfect Wi Fi link and still fail to reach a remote site.

  NAT and state
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-nat-and-state" />

Network Address Translation changes addresses as packets pass through a device.
The most common pattern is translating many private addresses to one public address.

NAT is not the same thing as a firewall.
Many devices combine NAT with stateful filtering, which is why people confuse them.

Common failure patterns:

1. The mapping expires and breaks a long lived flow.
2. A port is reused and traffic is delivered to the wrong internal endpoint.
3. An inbound flow is blocked because there is no mapping and no explicit rule.

  TLS and where it sits
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-tls-where-it-sits" />

TLS is the protocol most people mean when they say HTTPS.
TLS provides confidentiality and integrity for application data.

OSI explanations often place TLS in the presentation layer because it is about encoding and protection of data.
In TCP IP practice, TLS is usually treated as part of the application layer stack because it is above the transport layer.

This is the key point.
Layer models describe responsibilities. They do not force a protocol to live in one place forever.

  A troubleshooting method you can repeat
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="applied" sectionId="net-applied-troubleshooting-method" />

My method is simple.

1. State the user visible symptom in one sentence.
2. State what success would look like.
3. Pick the smallest test that isolates one layer boundary.
4. Record the result and update your hypothesis.

When you do this, you stop jumping straight to rare causes.

Pick one real page you trust. Use a browser.
Write down the DNS step, the TCP step, and the TLS step.
For each step, write one observation you could use as evidence.
