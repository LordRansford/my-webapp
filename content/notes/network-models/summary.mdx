# Summary

This page is a recap. It is designed to be short.

## The smallest set of terms that must be correct

1. A protocol is a set of rules for exchanging data.
2. Encapsulation wraps data with headers as it moves down the stack.
3. A frame carries a packet. A packet carries a segment or datagram.
4. DNS maps names to records such as IP addresses.
5. TLS protects data in transit. It does not make the application safe by itself.

## A troubleshooting checklist you can reuse

1. State the symptom.
2. State what success looks like.
3. Test one boundary at a time.
4. Record evidence.
5. Keep assumptions explicit.
