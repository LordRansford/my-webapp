<BodyText>
  In practice, the model becomes valuable when you can place controls and signals correctly.
  This level is about security and operations thinking, grounded in correct network foundations.

  Security by layer
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="practice" sectionId="net-practice-security-by-layer" />

Here is a simple way to avoid security theatre.
Put each control where it can actually work.

Examples:

1. A strong password policy does not fix a broken access control check in an API.
2. TLS protects data in transit. It does not validate what the application does with data.
3. A firewall can block unwanted traffic. It cannot fix an unsafe query inside your code.

Use layers to place your controls, then verify the control with a test.

  Observability and signals
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="practice" sectionId="net-practice-observability-and-signals" />

When a user says "the site is slow", you need signals that separate causes.

1. Link signals such as packet loss and retransmissions.
2. Transport signals such as connection time and resets.
3. Application signals such as response time and error rate.

If you only have application logs, you will miss many failure patterns.

  Packet captures without hacking

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="practice" sectionId="net-practice-captures-without-hacking" />

Packet capture is observation. It is not exploitation.
Only capture traffic you own or are authorised to inspect.

The goal in this course is interpretation:

1. Identify the protocols you see.
2. Confirm the order of events.
3. Relate a symptom to one layer boundary.

You do not need to craft attack traffic to learn these skills.

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="network-models" levelId="practice" sectionId="net-practice-enterprise-segmentation" />

Segmentation is the practice of limiting which systems can talk to which systems.
It reduces blast radius. It also makes incidents easier to contain.

I think in zones:

1. Public edge and CDN.
2. Application tier.
3. Data tier.
4. Admin and management plane.

The most common failure is letting the management plane become reachable from places it should not be.

Write a one page troubleshooting report for a made up incident.
The incident can be "users cannot load the login page" or "some users get random timeouts".

Your report must include:

1. Symptom and impact.
2. Three hypotheses, one per layer boundary.
3. One test per hypothesis.
4. What evidence would confirm or disprove each hypothesis.
