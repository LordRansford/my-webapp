### Building on What You Know

In the Foundations level, you learned:
- **Personal security**: Password managers, MFA, phishing detection
- **Core concepts**: CIA triad, encoding, hashing vs encryption
- **Basic threats**: Social engineering, malware, breach patterns
- **Network fundamentals**: DNS, HTTPS, attack surfaces

This Applied level deepens those concepts for **team and organizational security**. You'll learn:
- How to apply threat modeling to real systems
- How vulnerabilities connect into attack chains
- How authentication works at scale (JWT, OAuth2, sessions)
- How to detect and respond to incidents using logs
- How to make risk-based security decisions

**Key Shift**: From "How do I stay safe?" to "How do we build systems that resist attacks?"

<Callout variant="concept" title="Career Progression">
**Foundations** prepared you for: Junior analyst, Security awareness roles, Personal security improvement

**Applied** prepares you for: Security analyst, Junior engineer, Application security, SOC analyst (Tier 1-2)

**Practice** (Advanced) prepares you for: Security architect, Senior engineer, Security lead, CISO track

        "bcrypt or Argon2 (slow, salted, adaptive)",
        "Base64 encoding"
      ],
      correctIndex: 2,
      explanation: "Password hashing must be SLOW to resist brute force. bcrypt/Argon2 are designed for passwords with built-in salting and adjustable work factors. SHA-256 is too fast, MD5 is broken, and Base64 is encoding (not hashing)."
    },
    {

        "Man-in-the-Middle",
        "Session hijacking"

      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "Typosquatting uses similar-looking domains to trick users. This builds on Foundations phishing concepts and leads into Applied domain spoofing attacks."

      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "Integrity ensures data hasn't been tampered with. Foundations covered this with hashing for file integrity. Applied level uses integrity for session tokens, API calls, and database transactions."

      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation: "Foundations covered this: SMS 2FA can be intercepted via SIM swapping, SS7 attacks, or social engineering mobile carriers. Applied level explores session security where MFA matters even more."

## What Changes from Foundations to Applied?

### 1. Scale: Individual → Team/Organization

**Foundations Example**: "I use a password manager for my 20 accounts"

**Applied Example**: "How do we enforce MFA for 500 employees across 15 applications with SSO?"

### 2. Complexity: Single Control → Systems Thinking

**Foundations Example**: "Strong passwords resist brute force"

**Applied Example**: "How do we handle password resets securely? What if email is compromised? What's the account recovery flow? Where do we log failed attempts?"

### 3. Responsibility: Personal Safety → Protecting Others

**Foundations Example**: "I detect phishing to protect myself"

**Applied Example**: "How do I configure email filters to protect 1,000 users? What's the incident response if someone clicks?"

### 4. Trade-offs: Best Practice → Risk-Based Decisions

**Foundations Example**: "Always use the strongest encryption"

**Applied Example**: "Encryption adds latency. For this system, do we need encryption at rest? In transit? Both? What's the business impact of each choice?"

<Callout variant="insight" title="The Applied Mindset">
**Foundations asks**: "What's the right thing to do?"

**Applied asks**: "What's the right thing to do *in this context*, with *these constraints*, for *this risk level*, and how do we *verify it's working*?"
</Callout>

## Study Recommendations

### Time Commitment
- **Estimated**: 18 CPD hours total
- **Suggested pace**: 2-3 hours per week = 6-9 weeks
- **Intensive option**: 3-4 hours per week = 4-6 weeks

### Learning Approach

**1. Active Practice (Not Passive Reading)**
- Complete every interactive tool
- Write out threat models by hand first, then use the tools
- Pause videos to predict what happens next

**2. Connect to Foundations**
- When you see "JWT", recall "Foundations: hashing vs encryption"
- When you see "lateral movement", recall "Foundations: Target breach via HVAC vendor"
- Each Applied concept deepens a Foundations concept

**3. Apply to Your Context**
- If you work in development: Focus on Module 3 (vulnerabilities) and Module 4 (auth)
- If you work in operations: Focus on Module 5 (detection) and Module 6 (risk)
- If you're transitioning careers: Complete everything in order

**4. Use the Case Studies**
- Real breaches teach more than hypotheticals
- For each breach: Draw the attack chain, identify failed controls, propose fixes

### Success Metrics

You're ready for Practice (Advanced) level when you can:
- ✅ Threat model a system in 30 minutes using STRIDE
- ✅ Explain 5+ OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with examples
- ✅ Design secure authentication with JWT + refresh tokens
- ✅ Investigate an incident by analyzing logs
- ✅ Build risk matrices and prioritize vulnerabilities
- ✅ Explain security trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders
