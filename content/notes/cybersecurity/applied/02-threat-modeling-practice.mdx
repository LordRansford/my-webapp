### What You Already Know (Foundations Recap)

In Foundations, you learned:
- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability as security goals
- **Attack Surface**: Entry points where attackers can interact with your system
- **Trust Boundaries**: Where data moves between different security contexts
- **Real Breaches**: Target (HVAC vendor), Twitter (social engineering), Colonial Pipeline (no MFA on VPN)

**Applied Level Deepens This**: Now you'll systematically identify threats using STRIDE, map data flows, build attack trees, and create actionable threat models for real systems.

## Why Threat Modeling Matters

<Callout variant="concept" title="The Core Problem">
**Without threat modeling**: You defend everything equally (or nothing systematically)

**With threat modeling**: You focus effort where it reduces harm the most, given your constraints
</Callout>

### Real-World Impact

**Scenario 1: E-commerce Checkout**
- Without threat model: "Let's add security features"
- With threat model: "Card data crosses 3 trust boundaries. Boundary 2 (payment processor API) is highest risk. We'll focus logging and validation there."

**Scenario 2: File Upload Feature**
- Without threat model: "Check file size limit"
- With threat model: "Uploaded files can be executed (STRIDE: Tampering + Elevation of Privilege). We need: file type validation, content scanning, sandboxed storage, and execution prevention."

### What Threat Modeling Produces

A good threat model delivers:
1. **System boundary definition** - What's in scope, what's not
2. **Asset inventory** - What needs protection and why
3. **Data flow diagram** - How data moves between components
4. **Threat list** - Specific failure scenarios using STRIDE
5. **Risk-prioritized controls** - What to implement first
6. **Monitoring plan** - How you'll detect if threats materialize

## STRIDE: Your Threat Analysis Framework

**STRIDE** is a mnemonic for six threat categories developed by Microsoft. It builds directly on CIA triad from Foundations:

### S - Spoofing (Identity)
**Attacks**: Confidentiality via fake identity
**Foundations connection**: Remember phishing emails with fake sender addresses? That's spoofing.
**Applied examples**:
- Attacker impersonates legitimate user with stolen credentials
- API requests with forged authentication tokens
- Email sender spoofing (SPF/DKIM failures)
- Session hijacking with stolen cookies

**Questions to ask**:
- How do we verify identity?
- What happens if authentication is bypassed?
- Can one user impersonate another?

### T - Tampering (Data Modification)
**Attacks**: Integrity violations
**Foundations connection**: Remember hashing for file integrity? Tampering is what hashing prevents.
**Applied examples**:
- Modified database records (SQL injection)
- Intercepted and altered API requests (man-in-the-middle)
- Tampered log files to hide evidence
- Modified configuration files to bypass security

**Questions to ask**:
- What data could be modified in transit or at rest?
- How do we detect unauthorized changes?
- Is data integrity validated before use?

### R - Repudiation (Denial of Actions)
**Attacks**: Accountability failures
**Foundations connection**: Logs and audit trails prove actions happened.
**Applied examples**:
- User denies making a fraudulent transaction (no audit trail)
- Admin denies deleting data (insufficient logging)
- Attacker covers tracks by deleting logs
- No proof of who accessed sensitive data

**Questions to ask**:
- Can we prove who did what and when?
- Are logs tamper-resistant?
- What actions are NOT logged?

### I - Information Disclosure (Data Leaks)
**Attacks**: Confidentiality violations
**Foundations connection**: Remember encryption for data protection? This is what you're protecting against.
**Applied examples**:
- Exposed API keys in GitHub repositories
- Database backup files accessible on public S3 bucket
- Verbose error messages revealing system internals
- Unencrypted traffic captured on network

**Questions to ask**:
- What data is sensitive?
- Where could data leak unintentionally?
- Is data encrypted in transit AND at rest?

### D - Denial of Service (Availability)
**Attacks**: Availability violations
**Foundations connection**: The "A" in CIA triad.
**Applied examples**:
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application-level DoS (expensive queries, infinite loops)
- Distributed DoS (DDoS) overwhelming infrastructure
- Lockout mechanisms abused to deny legitimate access

**Questions to ask**:
- What could make the system unavailable?
- Are there rate limits on expensive operations?
- How do we handle resource exhaustion?

### E - Elevation of Privilege (Unauthorized Access)
**Attacks**: Authorization bypasses
**Foundations connection**: Remember password attacks and lateral movement from Target breach?
**Applied examples**:
- SQL injection leading to admin access
- Path traversal reading files outside allowed directory
- Insecure direct object references (change URL to access other users' data)
- Privilege escalation via unpatched vulnerabilities

**Questions to ask**:
- Can users access resources they shouldn't?
- How is authorization enforced?
- What happens if authorization checks fail?

<Callout variant="insight" title="STRIDE Maps to CIA Triad">
**Confidentiality** ← Spoofing, Information Disclosure
**Integrity** ← Tampering, Repudiation
**Availability** ← Denial of Service
**Plus**: Elevation of Privilege (Authorization)

STRIDE expands CIA from 3 goals to 6 specific threat types you can systematically analyze.
</Callout>

## Threat Modeling Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Define System Boundary

**What it means**: Draw a line around what you're analyzing. Everything inside is in scope. Everything outside is a dependency or external entity.

**Example - Login System**:
- **In scope**: Web application, authentication service, session management, database
- **Out of scope**: User's device security, browser vulnerabilities, network infrastructure (but document as dependencies)

**Why it matters**: Prevents scope creep. You can't threat model "everything."

### Step 2: Identify Assets

**What it means**: List what needs protection and why.

**Example - E-commerce System**:
- Customer credit card data (PCI DSS compliance, reputation)
- User accounts (privacy, trust)
- Product inventory data (business operations)
- Admin access (system control)

**Asset classification**:
- **Critical**: Loss causes severe harm (e.g., payment data)
- **High**: Loss causes significant harm (e.g., customer PII)
- **Medium**: Loss causes moderate harm (e.g., product descriptions)
- **Low**: Loss causes minimal harm (e.g., marketing images)

### Step 3: Create Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

**DFD Elements**:
- **External Entity** (square): User, external service, admin
- **Process** (circle): Application code, API, authentication service
- **Data Store** (parallel lines): Database, cache, file system
- **Data Flow** (arrow): HTTP request, database query, file read

**Example - Simple Login Flow**:
```
[User] --username/password--> [Web App] --query--> [Database]
                                   |
                              [Session Store]
```

**Trust boundaries** (dotted lines):
- Between user and web app (untrusted → trusted)
- Between web app and database (trusted → highly trusted)

### Step 4: Apply STRIDE to Each Element

**For each data flow, ask**:
- **S**: Can the source be spoofed?
- **T**: Can the data be tampered with?
- **R**: Can actions be denied?
- **I**: Can data be disclosed?
- **D**: Can the flow be disrupted?
- **E**: Can privileges be escalated?

**Example - User → Web App (login request)**:
- **S**: Yes - credential stuffing, phishing
- **T**: Yes - MITM if not HTTPS
- **R**: Maybe - need login attempt logs
- **I**: Yes - password sent in cleartext if not HTTPS
- **D**: Yes - rate limiting needed to prevent DoS
- **E**: Yes - SQL injection in login form

### Step 5: Identify and Document Threats

**Format**: "An attacker could [action] by [method] which would result in [impact]"

**Examples**:
- "An attacker could access other users' data by modifying the user_id parameter in the URL, which would result in unauthorized information disclosure"
- "An attacker could exhaust server resources by sending thousands of login requests, which would result in denial of service for legitimate users"
- "An attacker could gain admin access by exploiting SQL injection in the login form, which would result in elevation of privilege and full system compromise"

### Step 6: Rate Threats (Risk = Likelihood × Impact)

**DREAD Framework** (subset of risk assessment):
- **D**amage potential (1-10)
- **R**eproducibility (1-10)
- **E**xploitability (1-10)
- **A**ffected users (1-10)
- **D**iscoverability (1-10)

**Simple Risk Matrix**:
| Impact → | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|----------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| **Likely** | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| **Possible** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Unlikely** | Low | Low | Medium | High |
| **Rare** | Low | Low | Low | Medium |

### Step 7: Choose and Document Controls

**For each threat, decide**:
1. **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce risk
2. **Transfer**: Use insurance, outsource to third party
3. **Accept**: Document and accept the risk
4. **Avoid**: Remove the feature or change approach

**Control types** (builds on Foundations "defense in depth"):
- **Preventive**: Stop threats before they occur (input validation, authentication)
- **Detective**: Identify threats as they occur (logging, monitoring, IDS)
- **Corrective**: Respond after threats occur (incident response, backups)

## Hands-On: Threat Model a File Upload Feature

Let's apply STRIDE to a common feature.

### System Description

**Feature**: Users can upload profile pictures (JPEG, PNG, up to 5MB)

**Components**:
- Web application (frontend)
- API endpoint `/api/upload` (backend)
- File storage (S3-like object storage)
- Database (stores file metadata: filename, URL, user_id)

### Data Flow Diagram

```
[User] --upload file--> [Web App] --HTTP POST--> [API Server] --save--> [File Storage]
                                                       |
                                                   [Database]
                                               (stores metadata)
```

### Trust Boundaries

1. **User ↔ Web App**: Untrusted to semi-trusted
2. **Web App ↔ API Server**: Semi-trusted to trusted
3. **API Server ↔ Storage/DB**: Trusted to highly trusted

### STRIDE Analysis

**Threat 1: Spoofing**
- **Threat**: Attacker uploads file as another user
- **Control**: Authenticate API requests, tie uploads to session user_id
- **Risk**: High likelihood, High impact = **Critical**

**Threat 2: Tampering**
- **Threat**: Attacker modifies file after upload (e.g., replace with malicious file)
- **Control**: File integrity hashes, access control on storage
- **Risk**: Low likelihood (if permissions correct), Medium impact = **Low**

**Threat 3: Repudiation**
- **Threat**: User uploads illegal content, denies doing it
- **Control**: Log uploads with user_id, IP, timestamp
- **Risk**: Medium likelihood, High impact = **High**

**Threat 4: Information Disclosure**
- **Threat 1**: Uploaded files accessible without authentication
- **Control**: Authenticated URLs, signed S3 URLs with expiration
- **Risk**: High likelihood (default S3 is private), High impact = **Critical**

- **Threat 2**: Filenames reveal user data
- **Control**: Use random UUIDs for filenames, store original name in DB only
- **Risk**: Medium likelihood, Low impact = **Low**

**Threat 5: Denial of Service**
- **Threat 1**: Attacker uploads many large files to exhaust storage
- **Control**: Rate limiting, storage quotas per user, file size validation
- **Risk**: High likelihood (easy attack), Medium impact = **High**

- **Threat 2**: Attacker uploads files with expensive processing (e.g., zip bombs)
- **Control**: File type validation, content scanning, size checks BEFORE decompression
- **Risk**: Medium likelihood, Medium impact = **Medium**

**Threat 6: Elevation of Privilege**
- **Threat 1**: Attacker uploads executable disguised as image (e.g., `image.png.exe`)
- **Control**: Validate file content (magic bytes), not just extension. Store with forced content-type. Never execute uploaded files.
- **Risk**: High likelihood (common attack), Critical impact = **Critical**

- **Threat 2**: Attacker uploads malicious image with embedded exploit (ImageTragick, etc.)
- **Control**: Use image processing libraries with known vulnerabilities patched. Run processing in sandbox.
- **Risk**: Low likelihood (requires specific vuln), Critical impact = **Medium**

- **Threat 3**: Path traversal - upload to `../../../../etc/passwd`
- **Control**: Never use user-provided filename directly. Generate safe filenames server-side.
- **Risk**: High likelihood (common mistake), Critical impact = **Critical**

### Prioritized Control Implementation

**Phase 1 (Must-Have - Critical Risks)**:
1. ✅ Authenticate all uploads (tied to session user_id)
2. ✅ Generate random UUID filenames (prevent path traversal, info disclosure)
3. ✅ Validate file content via magic bytes (prevent executable uploads)
4. ✅ Signed URLs for file access (prevent unauthorized disclosure)

**Phase 2 (Should-Have - High Risks)**:
5. ✅ Rate limiting (10 uploads/hour per user)
6. ✅ Storage quotas (100MB per user)
7. ✅ Audit logging (user_id, IP, timestamp, filename, size)

**Phase 3 (Nice-to-Have - Medium Risks)**:
8. ⚠️ Malware scanning with ClamAV or cloud service
9. ⚠️ Image processing in isolated container
10. ⚠️ File integrity monitoring

**Accepted Risks**:
- Users can upload inappropriate (but non-malicious) content → Manual review/reporting system
- Sophisticated image exploits requiring 0-days → Accept (low likelihood, expensive to prevent)

## Attack Trees: Visualizing Attack Paths

**Attack trees** complement STRIDE by showing how threats connect into attack chains (builds on Foundations breach case studies).

### Attack Tree Structure

**Root**: Attacker goal (e.g., "Steal customer data")

**Branches**: Ways to achieve that goal

**Leaves**: Specific actions

### Example: Compromise Web Application

```
Goal: Gain unauthorized admin access
├── Exploit authentication
│   ├── Credential stuffing (AND: obtain leaked passwords, no rate limiting)
│   ├── SQL injection in login form
│   └── Session hijacking (AND: steal session cookie, no HTTP-only flag)
├── Exploit authorization
│   ├── Insecure direct object reference (change user_id in URL)
│   └── Privilege escalation via API (missing role checks)
└── Social engineering
    ├── Phish admin credentials
    └── Insider threat (bribe/coerce employee)
```

**AND vs OR gates**:
- **OR**: Any child succeeds → parent succeeds (easier for attacker)
- **AND**: All children must succeed → parent succeeds (harder for attacker)

### How This Connects to Foundations

**Foundations: Target Breach (2013)**
- Initial access: HVAC vendor credentials (social engineering)
- Lateral movement: Vendor network → Target network
- Privilege escalation: Access payment systems
- Collection: Scrape credit card data
- Exfiltration: Send data to external servers

**Attack Tree for Target Breach**:
```
Steal credit card data
├── Gain initial access [achieved via HVAC vendor]
├── Pivot to internal network [achieved via lateral movement]
├── Locate payment systems [achieved via network reconnaissance]
├── Access payment databases [achieved via credential theft]
└── Exfiltrate data [achieved via external FTP]
```

**Defense**: Each branch is a detection opportunity. Target failed at "Pivot to internal network" (no network segmentation) and "Exfiltrate data" (no egress monitoring).

<Callout variant="insight" title="Attack Trees Show Defense Priorities">
**Branches with many OR gates**: Easier to attack → Higher priority to defend

**Branches with many AND gates**: Harder to attack → Lower priority (but don't ignore)

**Deep trees**: More steps = more detection opportunities = defense in depth works here
</Callout>

## Real-World Threat Modeling Scenarios

### Scenario 1: SaaS Application Login System

**System**: Multi-tenant SaaS with username/password + optional MFA

**Key Threats (STRIDE)**:
- **Spoofing**: Credential stuffing, phishing, account takeover
- **Tampering**: Session token manipulation, JWT forgery
- **Repudiation**: No login attempt logs
- **Information Disclosure**: Session tokens in URL parameters
- **Denial of Service**: Brute force login attempts
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Horizontal (access other tenant's data) and vertical (regular user → admin)

**Critical Control**: Tenant isolation (data partitioned by tenant_id) with row-level security

### Scenario 2: Payment Processing API

**System**: REST API accepting credit card data, calling payment gateway

**Key Threats**:
- **Information Disclosure**: Card data logged, stored in plaintext, transmitted over HTTP
- **Tampering**: Transaction amount modified in transit
- **Repudiation**: No transaction audit trail
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Process refunds without authorization

**Critical Control**: PCI DSS compliance (encrypt card data, never log, secure transmission, strict access control)

### Scenario 3: Internal Admin Dashboard

**System**: Web interface for admins to manage users, view analytics

**Key Threats**:
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Regular users accessing admin panel (broken access control)
- **Information Disclosure**: Analytics data leaking to unauthorized users
- **Denial of Service**: Admin dashboard crashes under load, blocks all admin access

**Critical Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at API level (not just UI)

## Common Threat Modeling Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Broad or Too Narrow

**Too broad**: "Threat model our entire company"
- Unmanageable, never finishes
- **Fix**: Start with one system, one feature

**Too narrow**: "Threat model only the login button"
- Misses context and data flows
- **Fix**: Include entire authentication flow (login + session + logout)

### Mistake 2: Listing Every Possible Threat

**Problem**: 500-item threat list that's never acted on

**Fix**: Focus on realistic, high-impact threats. Use risk prioritization.

### Mistake 3: Threat Modeling After Building

**Problem**: Finding architectural flaws when code is already written

**Fix**: Threat model during design phase. Iterate as system evolves.

### Mistake 4: No Threat Ownership

**Problem**: Threats documented but no one responsible for mitigation

**Fix**: Assign owner and deadline to each mitigated threat. Track in backlog.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Accepted Risks

**Problem**: Accepting risks without documentation

**Fix**: Document accepted risks with business justification. Review quarterly.
