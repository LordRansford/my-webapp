  The course has three core levels plus a summary and games page. Move through them at your own pace and revisit the labs whenever you need a reset.

<LevelCards />

<SubsectionHeader emoji="🛡️">
  Level 1 - Cybersecurity Foundations
</SubsectionHeader>

This level is for children, beginners and anyone who does not see themselves as technical. We start with the basics:

- Data basics and how computers store it.
- Bits, bytes and encodings, plus why tiny changes matter.
- The CIA triad in plain language.
- Devices, networks and the internet without the noise.
- Everyday threats like phishing, weak passwords and unsafe Wi Fi.
- Habits that make you a safer digital citizen.

You will spend a lot of time in visual tools that live in the browser. For example, you can:

- Flip bits and watch hashes change.
- Try out different passwords and see how strength shifts.
- Inspect sample links and emails to decide what looks suspicious.
- Use a simple risk matrix to practise everyday choices.

The goal is to build intuition and habits without assuming any prior knowledge. The tone is friendly. I explain acronyms the first time they appear and I use short sentences.

<SubsectionHeader emoji="🎯">
  Level 2 - Applied Cybersecurity
</SubsectionHeader>

This level is for people who want to understand how systems fail and how we defend them. We build on the Foundations and start to think like attackers and defenders.

We cover topics such as:

- Threat modelling: assets, actors, entry points and trust boundaries.
- Networks and operating systems, with the boring bits made clear.
- Vulnerability classes like injection and broken authentication.
- Auth, sessions and cookies in real web flows.
- Logging, monitoring and incident basics.
- Risk decisions and trade offs you can defend.

Here you will see more schematic diagrams and flow diagrams. You also get interactive labs such as:

- Drag and drop threat modelling exercises.
- Safe, sandboxed injection examples with fixes.
- Log and alert viewers that help you spot suspicious behaviour.
- Risk and control dashboards to practise judgement calls.

The idea is to move from "I know the words" to "I can apply the ideas to real systems".

<SubsectionHeader emoji="🏗️">
  Level 3 - Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy
</SubsectionHeader>

This level is for people who want to think like security engineers, architects and leaders.

We bring everything together and look at:

- Enterprise risk and governance.
- Secure architecture for web and cloud systems.
- DevSecOps and secure software development practices.
- Vulnerability management using things like CVEs.
- Incident response and recovery.
- Legal, regulatory and ethical aspects of security.

You will work with higher level diagrams and more complex labs, for example:

- Designing small secure architectures with identity, logging and monitoring.
- Simulating basic incident response steps in a safe lab.
- Reviewing vulnerability information and prioritising what to fix first.
- Preparing short, non technical risk summaries for stakeholders.

By the end of this level you should be able to join up technical details with business and regulatory thinking and explain security decisions clearly.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🛡️" id="alignment">
  Alignment with CISSP, NIST CSF 2.0 and Cyber Essentials Plus
</SectionHeader>

This course is not an official exam preparation course and it is not endorsed by any certification body.

However, I have designed the structure and topics so that they align with:

- The high level domains in CISSP.
- The functions in NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, including the new Govern function.
- The five control areas in Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus.

In the background I maintain a mapping between my learning outcomes and these frameworks. This means:

- Foundations gives you the kind of basic understanding that Security Plus and the early parts of CISSP expect.
- Applied Cybersecurity connects directly to domains such as Security Architecture, Network Security, Identity and Access Management and Security Operations.
- Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy reflects more of the governance, risk, software security and operations thinking in CISSP and NIST CSF 2.0.

When I say "aligned", I mean that the knowledge areas broadly match. I still avoid exam specific lists and memorisation. The focus is on deep understanding and real world reasoning.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="📚" id="cpd">
  CPD and professional development
</SectionHeader>

I am writing these notes with Continuing Professional Development in mind.

For each level I define:

- Learning outcomes.
- Estimated guided learning hours.
- Labs and reflection activities.
- A simple assessment approach.

This structure is suitable for CPD credit and for use alongside formal programmes in universities or professional training. As the course matures I plan to seek CPD accreditation. When that happens I will update this page with the details.

<SectionHeader variant="guide" emoji="📚" id="how-to-use">
  How to use this course
</SectionHeader>

You can use the material in a few ways:

- Work through each level in order as a structured course.
- Dip into modules when you have a specific question or need a refresher.
- Use the tools and labs as a safe environment to practise without putting real systems at risk.

If you are using the course with a team or a class, you can pair the notes and tools with your own discussions, exercises and assessments.

The main thing is this. I want you to come away feeling that cybersecurity is understandable, that you can ask sensible questions, and that you can make better decisions about digital systems in your own context.
