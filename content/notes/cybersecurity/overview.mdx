# Cybersecurity course – from foundations to practice

I built this course because I wish I had something like it when I started working with data and digital topics.

Most cybersecurity material either assumes a lot of background or jumps straight into jargon and frameworks. My aim here is different. I want to take you from “I am not technical at all” to “I can reason about security like a professional” by combining clear notes, simple maths, practical tools and realistic scenarios.

The course is split into three levels. You can move through them at your own pace, and use the tools and labs as often as you like.

## How the course is structured

The Cybersecurity course has three levels.

<LevelCards />

### Level 1 – Cybersecurity Foundations

This level is for children, beginners and anyone who does not see themselves as “technical”. We start with the basics:

- What data is and how computers represent it.
- Bits, bytes, encodings and why small changes matter.
- The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- Simple ideas about devices, networks and the internet.
- Everyday threats like phishing, weak passwords and unsafe Wi Fi.
- Basic behaviours that make you a safer digital citizen.

You will spend a lot of time in visual tools that live in the browser. For example, you can:

- Flip bits and watch hashes change.
- Try out different passwords and see how strong they are.
- Inspect sample links and emails to decide what looks suspicious.
- Use a simple risk matrix to think about everyday choices.

The goal is to build intuition and habits without assuming any prior knowledge. The tone is friendly. I explain acronyms the first time they appear and I use short sentences.

### Level 2 – Applied Cybersecurity

This level is for people who want to understand how systems fail and how we defend them. We build on the Foundations and start to think like attackers and defenders.

We cover topics such as:

- Threat modelling: assets, actors, entry points and trust boundaries.
- Networks and operating systems in more detail.
- Vulnerability classes such as injection and broken authentication.
- Authentication, authorisation, sessions and cookies in web apps.
- Logging, monitoring and basic incident thinking.
- Structured risk decisions and trade offs.

Here you will see more schematic diagrams and flow diagrams. You also get interactive labs such as:

- Simple threat modelling exercises with drag and drop diagrams.
- Safe, sandboxed examples of injection and how to fix it.
- Log and alert viewers that let you practise spotting suspicious behaviour.
- Risk and control dashboards to practise judgement calls.

The idea is to move from “I know the words” to “I can apply the ideas to real systems”.

### Level 3 – Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy

This level is for people who want to think like security engineers, architects and leaders.

We bring everything together and look at:

- Enterprise risk and governance.
- Secure architecture for web and cloud systems.
- DevSecOps and secure software development practices.
- Vulnerability management using things like CVEs.
- Incident response and recovery.
- Legal, regulatory and ethical aspects of security.

You will work with higher level diagrams and more complex labs, for example:

- Designing small secure architectures with identity, logging and monitoring.
- Simulating basic incident response steps in a safe lab.
- Reviewing vulnerability information and prioritising what to fix first.
- Preparing short, non technical risk summaries for stakeholders.

By the end of this level you should be able to join up technical details with business and regulatory thinking and explain security decisions clearly.

## Alignment with CISSP, NIST CSF 2.0 and Cyber Essentials Plus

This course is not an official exam preparation course and it is not endorsed by any certification body.

However, I have designed the structure and topics so that they align with:

- The high level domains in CISSP.
- The functions in NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, including the new Govern function.
- The five control areas in Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus.

In the background I maintain a mapping between my learning outcomes and these frameworks. This means:

- Foundations gives you the kind of basic understanding that Security Plus and the early parts of CISSP expect.
- Applied Cybersecurity connects directly to domains such as Security Architecture, Network Security, Identity and Access Management and Security Operations.
- Cybersecurity Practice and Strategy reflects more of the governance, risk, software security and operations thinking in CISSP and NIST CSF 2.0.

When I say “aligned”, I mean that the knowledge areas broadly match. I still avoid exam specific lists and memorisation. The focus is on deep understanding and real world reasoning.

## CPD and professional development

I am writing these notes with Continuing Professional Development in mind.

For each level I define:

- Learning outcomes.
- Estimated guided learning hours.
- Labs and reflection activities.
- A simple assessment approach.

This structure is suitable for CPD credit and for use alongside formal programmes in universities or professional training. As the course matures I plan to seek CPD accreditation. When that happens I will update this page with the details.

## How to use this course

You can use the material in a few ways:

- Work through each level in order as a structured course.
- Dip into modules when you have a specific question or need a refresher.
- Use the tools and labs as a safe environment to practise without putting real systems at risk.

If you are using the course with a team or a class, you can pair the notes and tools with your own discussions, exercises and assessments.

The main thing is this. I want you to come away feeling that cybersecurity is understandable, that you can ask sensible questions, and that you can make better decisions about digital systems in your own context.
