# Practitioner  Detection and Response Analyst  
## Signals, certainty, and containment

<Callout variant="concept">
I live in ambiguity. My decisions must balance false positives, false negatives, and business impact. Ethics matters when action affects users.
</Callout>

## 1. Decision  Which signals matter most
Signal quality beats signal quantity. I prioritise signals that give high certainty with low noise.

## 2. Decision  When to act
Acting too early can disrupt business; acting too late increases impact. I document thresholds.

## 3. Incident realism  Build the timeline

</ToolCard>

## 4. Ethics and accountability
Containment can affect users. I apply least harm: preserve safety, respect privacy, and justify disruption.

<QuizBlock
  title="Response judgement check"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why is confidence important before containment", a: "Because containment can disrupt services and users; unjustified action erodes trust." },
    { q: "Why track assumptions during response", a: "Because decisions rely on them; if they are wrong, the response must adapt quickly." }
