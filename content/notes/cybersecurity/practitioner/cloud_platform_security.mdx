# Practitioner  Cloud and Platform Security  
## Identity centric defence and resilient platforms

<Callout variant="concept">
Cloud makes identity the control plane. My job is to design guardrails, verify shared responsibility, and keep recovery paths ready.
</Callout>

## 1. Decision  How to enforce least privilege in cloud
Permissions sprawl quickly. I design landing zones, baseline policies, and automated checks.

## 2. Decision  Which dependencies are safe enough
Cloud stacks rely on many managed services and images. I identify critical dependencies and plan verification.

## 3. Evidence and readiness
I need proof that controls work: guardrail tests, break-glass drills, backup restores, and audit trails.

## 4. Ethics and accountability
Cloud decisions affect cost, performance, and user trust. I document trade offs and ensure privacy and accessibility are respected.

<QuizBlock
  title="Platform judgement check"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why is identity the cloud perimeter", a: "Because most access is mediated by identity and API calls, not physical networks." },
    { q: "Why do I need rollback paths", a: "Because cloud misconfigurations propagate fast; safe rollback reduces blast radius." }
