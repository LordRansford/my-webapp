# Practitioner  Security Engineer  
## Decisions, evidence, and safe delivery

<Callout variant="concept">
This role lives close to systems. The work is not to add controls randomly. The work is to choose controls that reduce risk measurably without breaking the product.
</Callout>

## 1. Decision  What is the threat model for this change
I must define what I am defending and against whom. Without this, controls become theatre.

<GlossaryTip term="Threat model">
A threat model is a structured description of assets, attackers, attack surfaces, assumptions, and controls.

<QuizBlock
  title="Threat modelling in practice"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why is a threat model required before controls", a: "Because controls must reduce specific risks. Without a model I cannot justify choices or measure residual risk." },
    { q: "What is the most common threat model failure", a: "Assuming trusted networks or trusted users without verification." }
  ]}
/>

## 2. Decision  What evidence proves the control works
Controls that cannot be tested are beliefs, not security.

## 3. Incident realism  A timeline I must be ready for

## 4. Ethics and accountability
Security changes affect users. I keep friction proportional to risk. I avoid collecting unnecessary data. I am honest about uncertainty.

<QuizBlock
  title="Judgement check"
  questions={[
    { q: "What makes a security decision defensible", a: "Clear assumptions, evidence, known trade offs, and a recovery plan." },
    { q: "When is security friction unethical", a: "When it is disproportionate to risk or excludes users unnecessarily." }
