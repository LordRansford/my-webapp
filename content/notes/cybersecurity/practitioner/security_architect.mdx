# Practitioner  Security Architect  
## Designing for defensible systems

<Callout variant="concept">
My job is to design systems that fail safely. I make assumptions explicit, reduce blast radius, and ensure the system is observable.
</Callout>

## 1. Decision  Which assumptions are allowed
Architecture is mostly assumptions. I catalogue them, challenge them, and design controls to catch when they fail.

<ToolCard
  title="Map assumptions to controls"
  description="List core assumptions and pick controls that would detect or contain failure."
>
  <ControlSelectionTool />
</ToolCard>

## 2. Decision  How to prove the design is secure
Designs without evidence are optimistic. I need artefacts that show the design resists expected attacks.

<ToolCard
  title="Evidence checklist for architecture"
  description="Pick evidence sources that prove architecture properties, like segmentation tests and identity validation."
>
  <EvidenceChecklistTool />
</ToolCard>

## 3. Incident realism  When architecture fails
<ToolCard
  title="Architecture failure rehearsal"
  description="Walk through an incident where a boundary fails. Decide what isolates, what alerts, and what recovers first."

  <IncidentTimelineTool />
</ToolCard>

## 4. Ethics and accountability
Design choices affect safety, privacy, and inclusivity. I document impacts and seek consent when risk shifts to users.

    { q: "Why do assumptions need evidence", a: "Because assumptions without tests become silent failure points." },
