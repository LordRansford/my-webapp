<BodyText>
Welcome to your cybersecurity journey. Whether you are here to protect yourself online, advance your career, or build a foundation for professional certifications, you are in the right place.

Cybersecurity is not just about technology—it is about people, processes, and practical thinking. It is about understanding how systems work, where they break, and how to reduce real harm. Most importantly, it is a skill you can learn, regardless of your background.

<SubsectionHeader emoji="🎯" id="why-this-course">
  Why this course exists
</SubsectionHeader>

<BodyText>
This course takes a different approach from traditional cybersecurity training:

- **Plain language**: No unnecessary jargon. When technical terms are needed, they are explained clearly.
- **Practical focus**: Every concept connects to real-world scenarios you can apply immediately.
- **Interactive labs**: Learn by doing with browser-based tools that require no setup.
- **Progressive depth**: Start with foundations, build to applied skills, advance to strategic thinking.
- **CPD accredited**: Track your professional development hours with integrated evidence collection.
</BodyText>

<Callout title="Course philosophy" type="concept">
Security is not about being paranoid—it is about being prepared. It is not about perfect defense—it is about reducing risk to acceptable levels. It is not about blocking everything—it is about making informed trade-offs.

<BodyText>
**Common entry points:**

- **Security Analyst**: Monitor systems, investigate alerts, respond to incidents. Entry-level role that builds broad understanding.
- **Security Engineer**: Implement and maintain security tools, configure controls, automate tasks. Technical focus.
- **GRC Analyst**: Governance, risk, and compliance. Policy writing, audit support, risk assessment. Less technical, more process-focused.

**Typical progression:**
Junior Analyst → Senior Analyst → Lead/Architect or Manager → Director → CISO

**Alternative paths:**
- Start in IT/networking and transition to security
- Move from development to application security
- Shift from auditing to GRC leadership
</BodyText>

<Callout title="Reality check" type="info">
Most cybersecurity roles are not like movies. You will spend time on documentation, meetings, risk assessments, and process improvement. The "hacking" stereotype represents a tiny fraction of actual security work.

<SubsectionHeader emoji="📚" id="how-course-works">
  How this course works
</SubsectionHeader>

<BodyText>
This Foundations level is structured into 7 modules:

1. **Welcome** (this module) - Course introduction and your security baseline
2. **Why Cyber Matters** - Understanding real-world threats and impacts
3. **Data & Bits** - How information is represented and why it matters for security
4. **Networks & Packets** - How data moves and where vulnerabilities exist
5. **Threats & Defenses** - Common attacks and practical protection strategies
6. **Authentication & Privacy** - Identity, passwords, MFA, and personal data protection
7. **Checkpoint & Capstone** - Assessment, practical exam, and portfolio project

**Expected time commitment:**
- Total: 15 CPD hours (Continuing Professional Development)
- Per module: 1-3 hours depending on depth
- Labs and exercises: Approximately 40% of time
- Reading and quizzes: Approximately 60% of time

**How to succeed:**
- Complete modules in order—each builds on previous concepts
- Do not skip the interactive labs—hands-on practice is essential
- Take notes on concepts you find challenging
- Revisit sections that feel unclear before moving on
- Complete the quizzes honestly—they identify gaps in understanding

<Callout title="Why these habits matter" type="concept">
These practices follow the principle of "defense in depth"—multiple layers of protection. If one control fails, others remain. Security is not about perfection; it is about raising the cost and effort required for an attacker to succeed.

  Set your personal learning goals
</SubsectionHeader>

<BodyText>
Research shows that setting clear goals improves learning outcomes. Take a moment to define what you want to achieve:

**Questions to consider:**
- Why are you taking this course? (Career change, upskilling, personal protection, certification prep?)
- What specific skills do you want to develop?
- How will you apply this knowledge in the next 3 months?
- What success looks like for you by the end of this course?

**Write 2-3 specific, measurable goals:**

Examples:
- "Enable 2FA on all critical accounts within 2 weeks"
- "Complete a personal security audit using the tools in Module 6"
- "Explain common threats to my team in non-technical language"
- "Build foundation for CompTIA Security+ certification"
- "Transition from IT support to security analyst role within 6 months"

**Reflection prompt** (optional, for your notes):
Write down your goals now. Revisit them in Module 7 to measure progress and celebrate achievements.
