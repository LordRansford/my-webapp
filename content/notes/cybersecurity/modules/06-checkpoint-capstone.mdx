  title="Foundations Comprehensive Knowledge Check"
  questions={[
    // CIA Triad & Core Concepts
    { q: "A hospital's patient records are encrypted but the system crashes and data is unavailable for 24 hours. Which part of the CIA triad failed?", a: "Availability - the data exists and is protected (confidentiality, integrity) but cannot be accessed when needed." },
    { q: "You discover someone read your private messages but didn't change anything. Which CIA principle was violated?", a: "Confidentiality - unauthorized access to information even without modification violates confidentiality." },
    { q: "An attacker modifies financial transactions in transit without detection. Which CIA principle failed?", a: "Integrity - data was changed without authorization or detection, even if still confidential and available." },
    
    // Data & Encoding
    { q: "Why might SQL injection use URL encoding like %27 instead of a plain single quote?", a: "To bypass simple filters looking for literal quotes. Encoding obfuscates the payload while the server still interprets it correctly." },
    { q: "What's the key difference between hashing and encryption?", a: "Hashing is one-way (cannot be reversed), used for integrity. Encryption is two-way (can be decrypted with key), used for confidentiality." },
    { q: "Why is SHA-1 no longer recommended for security purposes?", a: "Collision attacks are practical - attackers can create two different inputs that produce the same hash, breaking integrity verification." },
    { q: "What makes bcrypt better than SHA-256 for storing passwords?", a: "bcrypt is intentionally slow and includes salt automatically. SHA-256 is fast, making brute-force attacks practical. Slow hashing protects passwords." },
    { q: "Why does changing one bit in input completely change a hash output?", a: "Avalanche effect - cryptographic hashes are designed so small input changes create unpredictable, large output changes to detect any modification." },
    
    // Networks & Protocols
    { q: "Why can metadata reveal sensitive information even when payload is encrypted?", a: "Metadata shows who communicated with whom, when, how much data, and access patterns - revealing behavior even without reading content." },
    { q: "What security problem does HTTPS solve that HTTP doesn't address?", a: "HTTPS encrypts data in transit, protecting confidentiality and integrity from eavesdropping and tampering between client and server." },
    { q: "Why is DNS a common target for attackers?", a: "DNS translates domain names to IPs. Attackers can redirect users to fake sites (DNS hijacking) or use DNS for data exfiltration." },
    { q: "What's the purpose of network segmentation?", a: "Separating networks by trust level limits lateral movement. If one zone is compromised, attackers can't easily reach other zones." },
    
    // Phishing & Social Engineering
    { q: "You receive an email from your bank with correct logo but URL is 'secure-bankofamerica-login.com'. Why is this phishing?", a: "The domain is not bankofamerica.com. Attackers register similar domains (typosquatting) with correct branding to fool victims." },
    { q: "What's the difference between phishing and spear phishing?", a: "Phishing is mass-sent generic attacks. Spear phishing is targeted at specific individuals using personalized information, making it more convincing." },
    { q: "Why is 'verify through independent channels' the best defense against social engineering?", a: "Attackers control the communication channel they initiated. Using a different channel (call official number, check in-person) confirms authenticity." },
    { q: "An email says 'Your account will be closed in 24 hours unless you verify immediately.' What social engineering tactic is this?", a: "Urgency - creating artificial time pressure to prevent verification and rational decision-making." },
    
    // Passwords & Authentication
    { q: "Why is 'correct horse battery staple' stronger than 'P@ssw0rd1!'?", a: "Length matters more than complexity. 25 characters of lowercase is harder to crack than 11 characters of mixed symbols. Entropy increases with length." },
    { q: "What's a rainbow table attack and how does salt prevent it?", a: "Rainbow tables are precomputed hashes of common passwords. Salt adds random data before hashing, making precomputed tables useless - each password gets unique hash." },
    { q: "Why should you never reuse passwords across accounts?", a: "When one service is breached, attackers use credential stuffing to try those credentials on other services. Unique passwords limit damage to single account." },
    { q: "What's the risk of using SMS for two-factor authentication?", a: "SIM swap attacks - attacker transfers your number to their SIM card, intercepting all SMS codes including 2FA." },
    { q: "Why are hardware security keys more secure than authenticator apps?", a: "Hardware keys are phishing-resistant - they verify the actual website domain. Fake sites can't intercept codes like they can with manually-entered TOTP." },
    
    // Malware & Threats
    { q: "What's the primary defense against ransomware?", a: "Regular, tested backups stored offline or immutably. If you can restore from backup, ransomware loses leverage and you don't pay." },
    { q: "How does a keylogger steal information?", a: "Malware records keystrokes, capturing passwords, messages, and other typed information which is sent to the attacker." },
    { q: "What's the difference between a virus and a worm?", a: "A virus requires user action to spread (opening file). A worm self-replicates across networks without user interaction." },
    { q: "Why is ransomware particularly effective against organizations?", a: "Downtime costs are high, data is critical, backups may be inadequate. Organizations face pressure to restore operations quickly, making ransom payment tempting." },
    
    // Breach Case Studies
    { q: "What was the primary entry point in the Target 2013 breach?", a: "Compromised credentials from a third-party HVAC contractor who had VPN access to Target's network without MFA." },
    { q: "What failed control could have prevented the Target breach from reaching payment systems?", a: "Network segmentation - vendor access zone should have been isolated from payment card systems, blocking lateral movement." },
    { q: "How did attackers compromise Twitter accounts in 2020?", a: "Social engineering multiple employees via phone to obtain credentials for internal admin tools that could take over any account." },
    { q: "What single control would have prevented the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack?", a: "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on VPN access. Attackers used a compromised password with no second factor required." },
    { q: "What pattern do Target, Twitter, and Colonial Pipeline breaches share?", a: "Basic security controls were missing (MFA, segmentation, training). Sophisticated attacks weren't needed - fundamental gaps were exploited." },
    
    // Privacy & Data Protection
    { q: "What is data minimization and why does it matter?", a: "Only providing necessary information. Less data shared = smaller privacy risk and less value to attackers if breached." },
    { q: "Why should you delete unused online accounts?", a: "Old accounts remain vulnerable to breaches, may contain reused passwords, and continue to expose personal data without benefit." },
    { q: "What does 'Have I Been Pwned' tell you?", a: "Whether your email or passwords appear in known data breaches, alerting you to change compromised credentials." },
    { q: "Why is it risky to post vacation photos in real-time on social media?", a: "Advertising an empty home invites burglary. Broadcasting location reveals patterns useful for physical or digital targeting." },
    
    // Defense & Controls
    { q: "What is defense in depth?", a: "Layering multiple security controls so single failure doesn't cause a breach. If one layer fails, others still provide protection." },
    { q: "Why is patching/updating software a critical security control?", a: "Updates fix known vulnerabilities. Unpatched systems are easy targets since exploit methods are public after vulnerability disclosure." },
    { q: "What's the difference between preventive and detective controls?", a: "Preventive controls stop attacks before they succeed (firewall, MFA). Detective controls identify attacks in progress or after (logging, monitoring, alerts)." },
    { q: "Why must backups be offline or immutable to protect against ransomware?", a: "Ransomware targets accessible backups. Offline/immutable backups can't be encrypted by attackers, enabling recovery." },
    
    // Risk & Decision-Making
    { q: "What's the difference between a threat and a vulnerability?", a: "Threat is what could cause harm (attacker, malware). Vulnerability is weakness that makes threat more likely to succeed (missing patch, weak password)." },
    { q: "Why might a high-threat scenario have low risk?", a: "Risk = likelihood × impact in YOUR context. High threat with low likelihood (strong controls) or low impact (minimal data value) = lower risk." },
    { q: "What does 'acceptable risk' mean in security decision-making?", a: "Risk level you're willing to tolerate given costs of controls, business needs, and likelihood/impact assessment. Not all risks can or should be eliminated." },
    
    // Practical Application
    { q: "You're asked to urgently wire $50,000 in an email appearing to be from your CEO. What should you do?", a: "Verify through independent channel - call the CEO directly using known number. Urgency is a red flag. CEO fraud/BEC attacks are common." },
    { q: "Your personal laptop's antivirus finds malware. What's your first priority?", a: "Disconnect from network to prevent spread or data exfiltration. Then assess damage and clean/restore system." },
    { q: "You receive a text saying your package couldn't be delivered with a tracking link. You didn't order anything. What is this?", a: "Smishing (SMS phishing) - attackers send fake delivery notifications to trick victims into clicking malicious links or revealing information." },
    { q: "A website you visit regularly suddenly shows an invalid certificate warning. What should you do?", a: "Do NOT proceed. Could indicate man-in-the-middle attack. Verify through different network or contact site directly. Never ignore certificate warnings." },
    { q: "You want to check email while at a coffee shop. What's the safest approach?", a: "Use cellular data instead of public WiFi, or use a VPN if you must use WiFi. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on untrusted networks." },
    
    // Career & Industry
    { q: "What's the most common entry-level cybersecurity role?", a: "Security Analyst - monitors systems, investigates alerts, responds to incidents. Builds broad understanding before specialization." },
    { q: "Why do organizations need both technical security and security awareness training?", a: "Technical controls fail when humans are tricked. Social engineering bypasses firewalls. People are both weakness and strength in security." },
