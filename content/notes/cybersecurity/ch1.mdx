Cybersecurity is about reducing real harm. It protects people, not just computers. It protects money, time, safety, privacy, and trust. When it goes wrong, it often looks ordinary at first. A bank transfer goes to the wrong place. A delivery address changes. A clinic cannot open a record. A small mistake becomes a big mess.

In plain language, my job in cyber is to stop normal mistakes from turning into expensive disasters. I am not trying to build an unbreakable fortress. I am trying to make the easy failures harder, make the hard failures visible, and make recovery faster.

Attackers succeed in the real world because most systems are normal systems. They are busy, messy, and connected. They have legacy tools, shared inboxes, rushed changes, and staff who are trying to get work done. The attacker does not need perfect skill. They need one good moment. They need one person to trust the wrong thing, or one system to accept an unsafe assumption.

In organisations, this is why security work is mostly about <GlossaryTip term="controls">Controls are the practical checks and safeguards that reduce risk, like MFA, approvals, logging, backups, and patching.</GlossaryTip> and decision making. You will see it in finance processes, HR systems, supplier access, and the boring bits like password resets and account cleanup. The glamorous hacker story is not the most common story.

Here is a short story I have seen in some form more than once. A finance team gets an email that looks like a supplier. The invoice is correct. The tone is correct. The bank details are new. The team is under pressure. They pay. A week later the supplier calls to chase payment. Nobody was hacked in a dramatic way. It was a quiet identity failure plus weak process. The outcome was still real loss.

Threats, vulnerabilities, and risk are not the same thing. A <GlossaryTip term="threat">A threat is something that could cause harm, like phishing, malware, or a dishonest insider.</GlossaryTip> is about what could happen. A <GlossaryTip term="vulnerability">A vulnerability is a weakness that makes a threat more likely to succeed, like reused passwords or missing patches.</GlossaryTip> is about what makes it easier. <GlossaryTip term="risk">Risk is likelihood and impact in your context. It is the decision about what you accept, what you reduce, and what you monitor.</GlossaryTip> A threat can exist with low risk if it cannot reach you. A vulnerability can exist with low risk if it has no meaningful impact. Context is the difference between a scary headline and a meaningful decision.

<MermaidDiagram caption="Threat, vulnerability, and risk in context">

  V[Vulnerability] -->|makes harm easier| H
  C[Context] -->|shapes likelihood and impact| R[Risk]
  H -->|creates impact| R
`}
</MermaidDiagram>

Everyday example: if you leave your house key under a plant pot, the threat is someone trying doors, the vulnerability is the predictable hiding place, and the risk depends on your street, your neighbours, and what happens if someone gets inside.

Common mistake: treating cyber as a list of bad things that might happen, instead of a set of assumptions you must test. Another common mistake is over focusing on rare, advanced attacks while ignoring easy ones that happen daily.

Why it matters: when you separate threat, vulnerability, and risk, you stop guessing. You can choose the control that reduces harm most, and you can explain that choice to a manager without waving your hands.

    </TimelineEvent>
  </Timeline>

  <RootCause>
    The breach succeeded because of multiple failures:
    - **Integrity failure**: No integrity checks on third-party scripts loaded on payment pages
    - **Trust boundary violation**: External scripts had access to sensitive payment form data
    - **Insufficient monitoring**: The malicious script ran undetected for over 2 months
    - **Weak segmentation**: Payment processing wasn't isolated from general web infrastructure
  </RootCause>

  <TechnicalDetails>
    The attackers used a technique called "Magecart" or web skimming:
    1. They compromised BA's website infrastructure (likely through stolen credentials or vulnerability)
    2. They modified legitimate JavaScript files to include malicious code
    3. The malicious code intercepted form data when customers entered payment details
    4. Data was sent to attacker-controlled servers disguised as legitimate analytics
    
    **How it relates to CIA triad:**
    - **Confidentiality**: Customer payment data was exposed to unauthorized parties
    - **Integrity**: The website code was modified without detection
    - **Availability**: Not directly affected, making the breach harder to detect
  </TechnicalDetails>

  <LessonsLearned>
    **For beginners, this case study teaches:**
    
    1. **Trust but verify**: Even your own website can be compromised. Use integrity checks (like Subresource Integrity) for all external scripts
    
    2. **Defense in depth matters**: A single control (perimeter security) wasn't enough. Multiple layers could have caught this earlier
    
    3. **Monitoring is critical**: The malicious code ran for 2+ months. Better monitoring of code changes and data flows could have detected it
    
    4. **Sensitive data needs special handling**: Payment data should be isolated and ideally never touch general web infrastructure
    
    5. **Incident response takes time**: Even large organizations with security teams can take months to detect sophisticated attacks
    
    **What you can do personally:**
    - Use virtual credit cards or PayPal for online shopping (limits exposure if a site is compromised)
    - Monitor your bank statements for unauthorized charges
    - Understand that even major companies can be breached - have a response plan for yourself

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="⚠️" id="assets-threats-risk">
  Assets, threats, and risk
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-data-and-bits" />

An <GlossaryTip term="asset">An asset is anything you care about enough to protect, like data, systems, people, time, and trust.</GlossaryTip> It includes obvious things like customer records and laptops, but also things like staff time, reputation, and the ability to keep operating. If payroll fails on Friday, that is an availability problem. If a patient record is wrong, that is an integrity problem. If a private email leaks, that is a confidentiality problem.

Risk is contextual. The same control can be essential in one place and pointless in another. A strict password policy does not help if the real attack path is a shared admin account. A fancy monitoring tool does not help if nobody knows what to do when it alerts. Controls without context turn into theatre. They look reassuring and then fail at the worst time.

This section aligns to CISSP Security and Risk Management and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Identify function. Identify is about understanding what you have, what matters, and what could go wrong. Without that, every other function becomes guesswork.

We will use one simple example for the rest of Foundations. Imagine a small clinic with an online booking system. The key assets are the patient data, the appointment schedule, the staff time, and the clinic's ability to operate. The threats include phishing, stolen passwords, ransomware, and honest mistakes. The vulnerabilities include reused passwords, no multi-factor authentication (MFA), and missing backups. The risk is how those realities combine for this clinic, not a generic list from a template.

In real organisations, this is how risk conversations should sound: "If this fails, who gets hurt, how quickly, and how would we know." This is why asset lists and data classification exist, even when they feel like paperwork. They make priorities explicit.

Everyday example: your phone is an asset, but so is your ability to get into your bank account. If your phone is lost, the worst case is not "my phone is gone." The worst case is "my identity is used to reset accounts." The asset is not the device. The asset is what the device unlocks.

Common mistake: starting with controls and tools instead of starting with assets and outcomes. People often buy a scanner, a dashboard, or an audit template before they can answer what they are protecting and why.

Why it matters: when you get the asset and context right, you can spend effort where it reduces harm. You stop doing security theatre and start doing risk reduction.

### After this section you should be able to:

- Explain why risk is contextual and what breaks when controls are applied blindly
- Explain how assets, threats, and vulnerabilities connect to real decisions
- Explain why Identify work comes before tool buying

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🔐" id="identity-access-trust">
  Identity, access, and trust
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-networks-and-packets" />

Identity is now the security perimeter because work happens everywhere. Staff work from home. Phones are used for approvals. Vendors have access. Cloud services connect to other cloud services. The question is no longer only "is the network safe". The question is "who is this, and what should they be allowed to do".

<GlossaryTip term="Authentication">Authentication is proving who you are, for example by a password plus a second factor.</GlossaryTip> <GlossaryTip term="Authorisation">Authorisation is deciding what you can do after you are authenticated, usually via roles and permissions.</GlossaryTip> People mix these up all the time, and systems do too. A login screen is authentication. Permissions and roles are authorisation. Weak authentication makes it easy to pretend. Weak authorisation makes it easy to abuse a real account.

Passwords are not evil. They are just easy to get wrong. Long passwords are better than clever passwords. Password reuse is the real disaster. <GlossaryTip term="MFA">Multi factor authentication adds a second proof so a leaked password is not enough on its own.</GlossaryTip> It reduces the damage when a password leaks. <GlossaryTip term="Least privilege">Least privilege means giving only the access needed for a job and no more, so mistakes and compromise have a smaller blast radius.</GlossaryTip> It is boring. It is also one of the best risk controls we have.

In real organisations, identity failures show up as: shared accounts, stale accounts, "temporary" exceptions that become permanent, and approvals done on the wrong channel. This is where audit findings come from, but it is also where incidents come from.

Everyday example: handing someone your house keys is authorisation. Checking their ID at the door is authentication. If you give a spare key to a neighbour "just in case" and never take it back, you created a long lived trust decision without noticing.

Common mistake: treating identity as a user experience detail instead of a safety system. Another common mistake is giving broad permissions because it is easier, then being surprised when something bad happens quickly.

Why it matters: when identity is strong and access is narrow, a compromised account does not automatically become a full breach. It buys time. It limits harm. It makes detection and recovery possible.

  </Timeline>

  <RootCause>
    The attack succeeded because of human and technical failures:
    - **Social engineering**: Attackers called Twitter employees pretending to be IT support, tricking them into providing credentials
    - **Excessive privilege**: Employees had access to internal admin tools that could control ANY account
    - **Weak authentication**: Internal tools didn't require strong MFA or additional verification for sensitive actions
    - **Insufficient training**: Staff weren't prepared to recognize or resist social engineering attempts
    - **No separation of duties**: Single employees could make account changes without approval
  </RootCause>

  <TechnicalDetails>
    The attackers used a combination of techniques:
    1. **Vishing** (voice phishing): Called Twitter employees pretending to be IT/security
    2. **Credential theft**: Convinced employees to enter credentials into fake login pages
    3. **Internal tool abuse**: Once inside, used Twitter's "admin panel" to reset account passwords and disable two-factor authentication
    4. **Bitcoin scam**: Posted tweets from compromised accounts asking followers to send Bitcoin with false promise of doubling their money
    
    **How it relates to security concepts:**
    - **Authentication failure**: Internal systems didn't verify employee identity strongly enough
    - **Authorization failure**: Employees had god-mode access they didn't need for daily work
    - **Trust boundary**: Attackers crossed from external (phone call) to internal (admin systems) by exploiting human trust

  <LessonsLearned>
    **For beginners, this case study teaches:**
    
    1. **Humans are the weakest link**: Even at a tech company like Twitter, employees can be tricked. No amount of technical security helps if attackers can convince staff to hand over credentials
    
    2. **Least privilege is critical**: Twitter employees had way more access than they needed. If tools had been restricted to "view only" or required manager approval for account changes, damage would have been limited
    
    3. **Phone/SMS are not secure authentication**: The attackers used phone calls and texts to bypass security. This is why SMS 2FA is considered weak - calls and texts can be intercepted or impersonated
    
    4. **Social engineering is real**: You don't need to be a coding genius to breach a major company. Good liars with basic technical knowledge can go far
    
    5. **Response matters**: Twitter's quick action to disable tweeting for verified accounts, while disruptive, prevented MORE damage
    
    **What you can do personally:**
    - Be skeptical of unexpected calls/emails asking for passwords or credentials, even if they claim to be from IT
    - Use hardware keys (like YubiKey) instead of SMS for two-factor authentication when possible
    - Never share passwords over phone, email, or text - legitimate IT won't ask
    - If someone pressures you urgently, that's a red flag. Attackers use time pressure to bypass your careful thinking
    - Verify unexpected requests through a separate channel (e.g., if IT calls, hang up and call the official IT number yourself)

**Why encoding matters for security:**

Attackers often use encoding to hide malicious payloads from simple filters. For example, SQL injection attempts might be URL-encoded or hex-encoded to bypass security controls that only look for plain-text patterns. Understanding how data can be represented in multiple ways helps you recognize obfuscation techniques.

Real example: The SQL command `SELECT * FROM users` could be encoded as:
- URL encoding: `%53%45%4C%45%43%54%20%2A%20%46%52%4F%4D%20%75%73%65%72%73`
- Hex encoding: `53454C454354202A2046524F4D207573657273`
- Base64: `U0VMRUNUICogRlJPTSB1c2Vycw==`

Simple keyword filters looking for "SELECT" would miss these encoded versions, but the server still interprets them correctly.

**Hashing vs Encryption - Key Differences:**

**Hashing (One-Way):**
- Cannot be reversed—you cannot get the original data back
- Used for integrity verification and password storage
- Same input always produces same output
- Tiny input change creates completely different hash (avalanche effect)
- Examples: MD5 (broken), SHA-1 (weak), SHA-256 (strong), bcrypt (password-specific)

**Encryption (Two-Way):**
- Can be decrypted with the correct key
- Used for confidentiality—protecting data in transit or at rest
- Same plaintext can produce different ciphertext (with different keys/IVs)
- Examples: AES, RSA, TLS/HTTPS

**Common mistake:** Storing passwords with SHA-256 instead of bcrypt/Argon2. SHA-256 is fast (good for file integrity, bad for passwords). Fast hashing enables brute-force attacks. bcrypt is intentionally slow with unique salts per password, making attacks impractical.

**Rainbow tables:** Pre-computed hashes of common passwords. If you hash "password123" with SHA-256, an attacker can instantly look it up in a rainbow table. Defense: use a salt (random data added before hashing) so the same password produces different hashes for different users. bcrypt does this automatically.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🛡️" id="defence-detection-response">
  Defence, detection, response
</SectionHeader>

Prevention alone fails. Not because people are lazy, but because systems are complex. Something will slip. A password will leak. A laptop will go missing. A supplier will get compromised. Defence needs layers, and it needs feedback.

This aligns to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Protect, Detect, and Respond functions. Protect reduces likelihood. Detect reduces time to notice. Respond reduces harm and recovery time. Cyber Essentials Plus focuses on practical technical controls that support this loop: secure configuration, access control, malware protection, patch management, and boundary protections.

Logging matters before incidents. <GlossaryTip term="Logging">Logging is recording important events so you can reconstruct what happened, spot anomalies, and prove or disprove a theory.</GlossaryTip> If you do not collect basic logs, you cannot tell what happened. Then every incident becomes a guessing game. You end up with panic, broad resets, and lost time. A simple response plan beats a heroic late night. It tells people who decides, who communicates, and what evidence to preserve.

In real organisations, this is the difference between "we think it was this account" and "we can show the exact sequence of actions." It is also why detection engineering is a real job. Good teams treat detection as a product: tuned, tested, and improved.

Everyday example: if a fire alarm goes off but nobody knows which room triggered it, everyone wastes time. If the alarm logs the room and the time, you can respond quickly and avoid a full building panic.

Common mistake: turning on every log and then drowning in noise, or logging nothing and then trying to do forensics with guesses. Another common mistake is writing an incident plan that nobody has rehearsed.

Why it matters: detection and response are how you limit harm when prevention fails. You cannot undo a breach with wishful thinking. You need evidence, speed, and clear ownership.

Under the hood, data still moves as packets. A packet has a header and a payload. The header is the envelope that tells the network where it is going. The payload is the content. Even when the payload is encrypted, metadata can still reveal behaviour. That is why monitoring often starts with patterns, not secrets.

**Network security concepts:**

**HTTPS (HTTP + TLS):** Encrypts web traffic between browser and server. Without HTTPS, passwords, credit cards, and personal data travel in plain text across the network—visible to anyone along the path. Look for the padlock icon in your browser. Never enter sensitive information on HTTP sites.

**DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates human-readable names (google.com) to IP addresses (142.250.185.78). DNS is often unencrypted, revealing which sites you visit even if HTTPS encrypts the page content. DNS can be hijacked to redirect users to fake sites (phishing). Defense: Use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) when possible.

**VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates encrypted tunnel between your device and VPN server. Hides your traffic from local network observers (coffee shop WiFi, ISP). But the VPN provider can still see your traffic—choose carefully. Not all VPNs are equal in security or privacy.

**Network Segmentation:** Separating networks by trust level or function. Example: Guest WiFi separate from corporate network, payment systems separate from general business network. If one zone is compromised, attackers can't easily reach other zones. Critical lesson from Target breach: vendor access wasn't segmented from payment systems.

**Common network attacks:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attacker intercepts traffic between two parties. Defense: HTTPS, certificate validation.
- **DNS Hijacking:** Attacker redirects DNS queries to malicious servers. Defense: DNSSEC, DNS-over-HTTPS.
- **Packet Sniffing:** Capturing network traffic to steal credentials or sensitive data. Defense: Encryption (HTTPS, VPN).
- **ARP Spoofing:** Attacker tricks devices into sending traffic to wrong destination. Defense: Network monitoring, static ARP entries.

**Real-world scenario: Home Network Security**

Your home network is an attack surface too. Consider:
- **Router:** Default passwords? Firmware updated? Guest network enabled for visitors?
- **IoT devices:** Smart speakers, cameras, thermostats often have weak security
- **WiFi:** WPA3 encryption (not WPA2 or WEP)? Strong password? Hidden SSID doesn't add much security
- **Devices:** Phones, laptops, tablets all need updates and protection

A compromised smart camera can be used to spy on you, launch attacks on other devices, or join a botnet for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Security isn't just about corporate networks.

  Confidentiality, integrity, availability and simple attacks
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-cia-and-simple-attacks" />

To keep this practical, we will use one simple frame: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, often shortened to CIA. Confidentiality means only the right people can see information. Integrity means changes are correct and visible. Availability means systems are there when needed. The purpose is not to memorise three words. The purpose is to ask better questions.

In plain language: confidentiality is about privacy, integrity is about truth, and availability is about being able to function. Most incidents are one of these three, usually with a second one following close behind.

When identity is weak, confidentiality fails. When changes are untracked, integrity fails. When backups are missing, availability fails. Good governance makes those failures less likely because it makes the decisions explicit and reviewed.

In real organisations, CIA is how you explain impact to non security people. A leader might not care about a vulnerability ID, but they do care about "patients could not be seen" or "invoices were changed" or "private data leaked." CIA translates technical failures into outcomes.

Everyday example: confidentiality is your bank statement being private, integrity is your balance being correct, and availability is being able to pay for groceries when you are at the checkout.

Common mistake: thinking CIA is a checklist where you must maximise all three at once. In practice you trade. Tight security might reduce availability if you lock out staff too often. High availability might reduce confidentiality if you spread access too widely. The job is to choose wisely and explain the trade.

Why it matters: CIA is a simple way to reason about controls and to spot what kind of harm you are actually preventing. It helps you avoid security theatre and focus on outcomes.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="👥" id="human-factors-governance">
  Human factors and governance
</SectionHeader>

Humans are not the weakest link. Humans are the system. Most insecure behaviour is a rational response to a bad setup. If it takes five minutes to do the safe thing, people will do the fast thing. If approvals block urgent work, people will route around them. If security tools produce noise, people will ignore them.

<GlossaryTip term="Governance">Governance is how decisions are made and owned, including who accepts risk, who funds controls, and who is accountable.</GlossaryTip> It is decision making, not paperwork. It is how an organisation decides what it will accept, what it will fix, and who owns the trade offs. CISSP governance principles focus on accountability, risk ownership, and clear policy that matches reality.

Real organisational failures are often not technical. They are unclear ownership, unclear priorities, and no rehearsal for bad days. The paperwork shows up after the incident, usually with a new template and a tired team.

In real organisations, governance shows up as: who is allowed to approve exceptions, how access is granted and removed, how incidents are escalated, and what gets funded. Good governance is boring in the best way. It makes security decisions repeatable instead of emotional.

Everyday example: if nobody is clearly responsible for locking up at night, it eventually becomes "someone will do it." That is not a plan. Governance is deciding who locks up, how you check, and what happens if it is missed.

Common mistake: blaming individuals for predictable system failures. Another common mistake is writing policies that describe an ideal world and then punishing people for living in the real one.

Why it matters: human factors and governance are what make security sustainable. Without them, controls decay, exceptions pile up, and the organisation only gets serious after harm has happened.

### After this section you should be able to:

- Explain why humans are part of the system and what breaks when processes are unrealistic
- Explain governance as ownership of trade offs, not documents
- Explain why clear roles and rehearsed response reduce harm
