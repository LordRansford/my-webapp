  Module F0. What cybersecurity is and is not
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f0-what-security-is" />

Cybersecurity is the practice of reducing risk in **digital systems**. It is not magic. It is not perfection. It is a set of decisions and controls that make harm less likely, less severe, and easier to recover from when it happens.

If you are a child, think of it like this. The internet is a busy city. Cybersecurity is how we do four things.

1. Lock doors that should be locked
2. Check who is allowed in
3. Notice when something looks wrong
4. Have a plan for when mistakes happen

You will hear the word **cyber** used as shorthand. Historically it connects to **cybernetics**, the study of control and communication in animals and machines. That term comes from the Greek *kybernētēs*, meaning “steering” or “governor”. It is a good reminder. Security is about steering risk, not pretending risk does not exist.

### Four terms people mix up

Let’s define four common terms precisely, using simple language.

- <GlossaryTip term="Vulnerability">A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that could be used to cause harm. One example is a login page that lets you try unlimited passwords.</GlossaryTip>
- <GlossaryTip term="Exploit">An exploit is a method or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability. One example is repeatedly guessing passwords until one works.</GlossaryTip>
- <GlossaryTip term="Incident">An incident is a security event that needs attention. It might be harmless, or it might become serious. One example is suspicious logins from a new country.</GlossaryTip>
- <GlossaryTip term="Breach">A breach is when security is broken and a real security objective is violated, such as private data being accessed or stolen.</GlossaryTip>

Notice the difference.

1. A vulnerability can exist even if nobody uses it.
2. An exploit is about how the weakness is used.
3. An incident is about what happened and whether it needs response.
4. A breach is about impact. One example is confidentiality being broken.

### What this course deliberately does not teach

This course is defensive and ethical. It does not teach you to break into systems. It teaches you to understand risk, spot weak assumptions, and choose controls that protect people.

Here is a short story that shows what “cyber” looks like in real life. A finance team gets an email that looks like a supplier. The invoice is correct. The tone is correct. The bank details are new. The team is under pressure. They pay. A week later the supplier calls to chase payment. Nobody was hacked in a dramatic way. It was an identity failure plus a weak process. The outcome was still real loss.

<MermaidDiagram caption="Threat, vulnerability, and risk in context">

  T[Threat] -->|tries to cause harm| H[Harm]
  V[Vulnerability] -->|makes harm easier| H
  C[Context] -->|shapes likelihood and impact| R[Risk]
  H -->|creates impact| R
`}
</MermaidDiagram>

Everyday example. If you leave your house key under a plant pot, the threat is someone trying doors, the vulnerability is the predictable hiding place, and the risk depends on your street, your neighbours, and what happens if someone gets inside.

Common mistake. Treating cybersecurity as a list of scary words, instead of a habit of checking assumptions. Another common mistake is over focusing on rare, advanced attacks while ignoring the easy ones that happen daily.

Why it matters. When you separate threat, vulnerability, and risk, you stop guessing. You can choose the control that reduces harm most, and you can explain that choice to a manager without waving your hands.

  Module F1. Risk and security outcomes
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f1-risk-and-outcomes" />

Security is risk management. That sounds like boring business language, but it is actually what makes security **real**. You start by being clear about what matters, what could go wrong, and what you will do about it.

An <GlossaryTip term="Asset">An asset is anything you care about enough to protect, such as data, systems, people, money, time, and trust.</GlossaryTip> It includes obvious things like customer records and laptops, but also things like staff time, reputation, and the ability to keep operating. If payroll fails on Friday, that is an availability problem. If a patient record is wrong, that is an integrity problem. If a private email leaks, that is a confidentiality problem.

Risk is contextual. The same control can be essential in one place and pointless in another. A strict password policy does not help if the real attack path is a shared admin account. A fancy monitoring tool does not help if nobody knows what to do when it alerts. Controls without context turn into theatre. They look reassuring and then fail at the worst time.

This section aligns to CISSP Security and Risk Management and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Identify function. Identify is about understanding what you have, what matters, and what could go wrong. Without that, every other function becomes guesswork.

We will use one simple example for the rest of Foundations. Imagine a small clinic with an online booking system. The key assets are the patient data, the appointment schedule, the staff time, and the clinic's ability to operate. The threats include phishing, stolen passwords, ransomware, and honest mistakes. The vulnerabilities include reused passwords, no multi-factor authentication (MFA), and missing backups. The risk is how those realities combine for this clinic, not a generic list from a template.

In real organisations, this is how risk conversations should sound. "If this fails, who gets hurt, how quickly, and how would we know." This is why asset lists and data classification exist, even when they feel like paperwork. They make priorities explicit.

Everyday example. Your phone is an asset, but so is your ability to get into your bank account. If your phone is lost, the worst case is not "my phone is gone." The worst case is "my identity is used to reset accounts." The asset is not the device. The asset is what the device unlocks.

Common mistake. Starting with controls and tools instead of starting with assets and outcomes. People often buy a scanner, a dashboard, or an audit template before they can answer what they are protecting and why.

Why it matters. When you get the asset and context right, you can spend effort where it reduces harm. You stop doing security theatre and start doing risk reduction.

### After this section you should be able to

1. Explain why risk is contextual and what breaks when controls are applied blindly
2. Explain how assets, threats, and vulnerabilities connect to real decisions
3. Explain why Identify work comes before tool buying

  Module F5. Identity and access
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f5-identity-and-access" />

Identity is now the security perimeter because work happens everywhere. Staff work from home. Phones are used for approvals. Vendors have access. Cloud services connect to other cloud services. The question is no longer only "is the network safe". The question is "who is this, and what should they be allowed to do".

<GlossaryTip term="Authentication">Authentication is proving who you are, for example by a password plus a second factor.</GlossaryTip> <GlossaryTip term="Authorisation">Authorisation is deciding what you can do after you are authenticated, usually via roles and permissions.</GlossaryTip> People mix these up all the time, and systems do too. A login screen is authentication. Permissions and roles are authorisation. Weak authentication makes it easy to pretend. Weak authorisation makes it easy to abuse a real account.

Passwords are not evil. They are just easy to get wrong. Long passwords are better than clever passwords. Password reuse is the real disaster. <GlossaryTip term="MFA">Multi factor authentication adds a second proof so a leaked password is not enough on its own.</GlossaryTip> It reduces the damage when a password leaks. <GlossaryTip term="Least privilege">Least privilege means giving only the access needed for a job and no more, so mistakes and compromise have a smaller blast radius.</GlossaryTip> It is boring. It is also one of the best risk controls we have.

In real organisations, identity failures show up as shared accounts, stale accounts, "temporary" exceptions that become permanent, and approvals done on the wrong channel. This is where audit findings come from, but it is also where incidents come from.

Everyday example. Handing someone your house keys is authorisation. Checking their ID at the door is authentication. If you give a spare key to a neighbour "just in case" and never take it back, you created a long lived trust decision without noticing.

Common mistake. Treating identity as a user experience detail instead of a safety system. Another common mistake is giving broad permissions because it is easier, then being surprised when something bad happens quickly.

Why it matters. When identity is strong and access is narrow, a compromised account does not automatically become a full breach. It buys time. It limits harm. It makes detection and recovery possible.

### After this section you should be able to

1. Explain the difference between authentication and authorisation
2. Explain what breaks when identity is treated as a soft control
3. Explain why least privilege reduces blast radius during incidents

**Why encoding matters for security**

Encoding changes how text is *represented*, not what it *means*. The security problem happens when one part of a system validates the data one way, but another part interprets it differently. Also, naive keyword checks can miss encoded variants, which is why we prefer robust parsing and context-aware validation.

Benign example. The word `SELECT` can look very different once encoded, but it is still the same underlying bytes. The lesson is not “memorise encoded strings”. The lesson is “do not rely on brittle string checks for security”.

If you are building or reviewing a system, the safer approach is this.

1. Parse inputs using a trusted parser for that format
2. Validate based on the expected structure and context
3. Encode outputs in the correct context. Examples include HTML, URL, JSON

**Hashing vs encryption key differences**

Hashing is one way. You cannot reverse it. It is used for integrity checks and for storing passwords with specialised password hashing. Encryption is two way. You can decrypt with a key. It is used for confidentiality in transit and at rest.

1. Hashing is one way and it is not reversible
2. Encryption is reversible with the correct key
3. A common mistake is storing passwords with a fast hash such as SHA 256. Use bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt instead
4. Rainbow tables are precomputed hashes of common passwords. Salts help prevent simple lookups. Password hashing schemes handle salts for you

  Module F3. Networks, transport, and what leaks
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f3-networks-and-transport" />

Prevention alone fails. Not because people are lazy, but because systems are complex. Something will slip. A password will leak. A laptop will go missing. A supplier will get compromised. Defence needs layers, and it needs feedback.

This aligns to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Protect, Detect, and Respond functions. Protect reduces likelihood. Detect reduces time to notice. Respond reduces harm and recovery time. Cyber Essentials Plus focuses on practical technical controls that support this loop. Examples include secure configuration, access control, malware protection, patch management, and boundary protections.

Logging matters before incidents. <GlossaryTip term="Logging">Logging is recording important events so you can reconstruct what happened, spot anomalies, and prove or disprove a theory.</GlossaryTip> If you do not collect basic logs, you cannot tell what happened. Then every incident becomes a guessing game. You end up with panic, broad resets, and lost time. A simple response plan beats a heroic late night. It tells people who decides, who communicates, and what evidence to preserve.

In real organisations, this is the difference between "we think it was this account" and "we can show the exact sequence of actions." It is also why detection engineering is a real job. Good teams treat detection as a product that is tuned, tested, and improved.

Everyday example. If a fire alarm goes off but nobody knows which room triggered it, everyone wastes time. If the alarm logs the room and the time, you can respond quickly and avoid a full building panic.

Common mistake. Turning on every log and then drowning in noise, or logging nothing and then trying to do forensics with guesses. Another common mistake is writing an incident plan that nobody has rehearsed.

Why it matters. Detection and response are how you limit harm when prevention fails. You cannot undo a breach with wishful thinking. You need evidence, speed, and clear ownership.

Under the hood, data still moves as packets. A packet has a header and a payload. The header is the envelope that tells the network where it is going. The payload is the content. Even when the payload is encrypted, metadata can still reveal behaviour. That is why monitoring often starts with patterns, not secrets.

**Network security concepts**

1. HTTPS uses HTTP with TLS. It protects data in transit between browser and server. It does not hide all metadata.
2. DNS stands for Domain Name System. It turns names into IP addresses. DNS can be attacked or manipulated, which is why secure DNS options exist.
3. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It creates an encrypted tunnel to a VPN provider. It can protect traffic from local observers, but the VPN provider still becomes a point of trust.
4. Network segmentation means separating networks by trust level or function. It limits blast radius when something is compromised.

**Common network attack patterns**

1. Man in the middle, often shortened to MitM. An attacker tries to intercept traffic. TLS and certificate validation help.
2. DNS hijacking. An attacker tries to redirect name lookups. DNSSEC and encrypted DNS help.
3. Packet sniffing. An attacker captures traffic. Encryption helps.
4. ARP spoofing. An attacker tries to confuse devices about who is who on a local network. Monitoring and secure network design help.

**Real world scenario. Home network security**

Your home network is an attack surface too. Consider four areas.

1. Router. Default passwords, firmware updates, guest network
2. IoT devices. Smart speakers, cameras, and thermostats often have weak security
3. WiFi. WPA3 where possible, strong passphrase, guest network separation
4. Devices. Phones, laptops, and tablets need updates and protection

A compromised smart camera can be used to spy on you, launch attacks on other devices, or join a botnet for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Security isn't just about corporate networks.

  Module F4. CIA and simple attacks
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f4-cia-and-simple-attacks" />

To keep this practical, we will use one simple frame. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are often shortened to CIA. Confidentiality means only the right people can see information. Integrity means changes are correct and visible. Availability means systems are there when needed. The purpose is not to memorise three words. The purpose is to ask better questions.

In plain language, confidentiality is about privacy, integrity is about truth, and availability is about being able to function. Most incidents are one of these three, usually with a second one following close behind.

When identity is weak, confidentiality fails. When changes are untracked, integrity fails. When backups are missing, availability fails. Good governance makes those failures less likely because it makes the decisions explicit and reviewed.

In real organisations, CIA is how you explain impact to non security people. A leader might not care about a vulnerability ID, but they do care about "patients could not be seen" or "invoices were changed" or "private data leaked." CIA translates technical failures into outcomes.

Everyday example. Confidentiality is your bank statement being private, integrity is your balance being correct, and availability is being able to pay for groceries when you are at the checkout.

Common mistake. Thinking CIA is a checklist where you must maximise all three at once. In practice you trade. Tight security might reduce availability if you lock out staff too often. High availability might reduce confidentiality if you spread access too widely. The job is to choose wisely and explain the trade.

Why it matters. CIA is a simple way to reason about controls and to spot what kind of harm you are actually preventing. It helps you avoid security theatre and focus on outcomes.

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-f6-human-factors-and-phishing" />

Humans are not the weakest link. Humans are the system. Most insecure behaviour is a rational response to a bad setup. If it takes five minutes to do the safe thing, people will do the fast thing. If approvals block urgent work, people will route around them. If security tools produce noise, people will ignore them.

<GlossaryTip term="Governance">Governance is how decisions are made and owned, including who accepts risk, who funds controls, and who is accountable.</GlossaryTip> It is decision making, not paperwork. It is how an organisation decides what it will accept, what it will fix, and who owns the trade offs. CISSP governance principles focus on accountability, risk ownership, and clear policy that matches reality.

Real organisational failures are often not technical. They are unclear ownership, unclear priorities, and no rehearsal for bad days. The paperwork shows up after the incident, usually with a new template and a tired team.

In real organisations, governance shows up as: who is allowed to approve exceptions, how access is granted and removed, how incidents are escalated, and what gets funded. Good governance is boring in the best way. It makes security decisions repeatable instead of emotional.

Everyday example. If nobody is clearly responsible for locking up at night, it eventually becomes "someone will do it." That is not a plan. Governance is deciding who locks up, how you check, and what happens if it is missed.

Common mistake. Blaming individuals for predictable system failures. Another common mistake is writing policies that describe an ideal world and then punishing people for living in the real one.

Why it matters. Human factors and governance are what make security sustainable. Without them, controls decay, exceptions pile up, and the organisation only gets serious after harm has happened.

### After this section you should be able to

1. Explain why humans are part of the system and what breaks when processes are unrealistic
2. Explain governance as ownership of trade offs, not documents
3. Explain why clear roles and rehearsed response reduce harm

Privacy is a security property. It is about reducing harm from unnecessary collection, unnecessary sharing, and unnecessary retention. If you collect less data, there is less data to leak. If you keep data for less time, there is less to steal later.
