## Why cybersecurity matters in real life

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-why-cyber-matters" />

Cybersecurity is about avoiding real harm. Bills go to the wrong person, hospital systems lock up, payroll fails, or private data leaks. The point is not perfect safety; it is making harm less likely and making mistakes visible and recoverable.

Every system is a set of decisions about who should see what, who can change it, and how we recover when things break. This course starts with the smallest pieces so later topics feel grounded.

## Data, bits and how information lives in a computer

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-data-and-bits" />

Everything a computer stores is built from bits. A bit is a single switch that is either off or on. Eight bits make a byte. A byte can represent numbers from 0 to 255 in decimal, which is why 255 appears in settings. Flip the leftmost bit and you change the number by 128; flip the rightmost and you change it by 1.

To turn bytes into letters and symbols we use an encoding: a shared map from numbers to characters. ASCII maps 65 to the letter A. <GlossaryTip term="UTF 8">A modern encoding that uses one or more bytes per character so it can represent many languages.</GlossaryTip> Encoding mistakes create security bugs because the same bytes get read differently.

If you want to see binary in practice, take decimal 13. In binary it is 1101 (8 + 4 + 1). Flip the leftmost 1 to 0 and the value drops by 8. That is all computers are doing at the base layer.

## How data travels on networks

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-networks-and-packets" />

When you send a message across the internet, you are not sending one blob. Your device chops data into packets. Each packet carries a header and a payload. The payload is the part we care about, such as part of your email. The header is the envelope telling the network where the packet is going and where it came from.

Even when the payload is encrypted, metadata can still be revealing. Timing, destination and size help someone guess what you are doing. Protocols like HTTP and TLS sit on top of lower layers that move packets. Think of the OSI model as a map: lower layers move bits, middle layers move packets, upper layers handle applications. Security controls often live at specific layers, such as TLS for encryption or firewalls for filtering.

## Confidentiality, integrity, availability and simple attacks

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="foundations" sectionId="foundations-cia-and-simple-attacks" />

Confidentiality means only the right people can see information. Integrity means information or systems are not changed silently. Availability means systems are up when people need them. Attacks often target weak assumptions: guessing weak passwords hits confidentiality, tampering in transit hits integrity, and denial of service hits availability.

Trust is a decision, not a default. Each control should be tied to a clear trust choice: who can see data, who can change it, and what happens when something fails.
