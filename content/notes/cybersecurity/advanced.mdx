## Cryptography in practice

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="practice" sectionId="advanced-crypto-practice" />

Crypto is only useful when it is applied correctly. TLS works because both sides agree a <GlossaryTip term="cipher suite">set of algorithms for key exchange, encryption and integrity</GlossaryTip>. A <GlossaryTip term="certificate authority">trusted issuer of certificates</GlossaryTip> vouches for a site identity. <GlossaryTip term="mutual TLS">Both client and server present certificates</GlossaryTip> when both need to prove who they are. Keys must be generated well, stored safely, rotated, and revoked when things change.

<DiagramBlock
  title="High level TLS handshake"
  subtitle="Client and server agree how to talk securely, check identities with certificates, then switch to encrypted traffic."
>
  <div className="text-xs sm:text-sm leading-5 space-y-2">
    <div>Client → ClientHello (supported cipher suites, random)</div>
    <div>Server → ServerHello (chosen suite) + Certificate</div>
    <div>Key exchange → shared secret derived</div>
    <div>Both sides switch to encrypted application data</div>
  </div>
</DiagramBlock>

Common mistakes: outdated algorithms, self-signed certificates where trust is needed, weak random number generation, keys shared between environments, and skipping verification. Good practice: modern suites, short-lived certificates, hardware-backed keys where possible, least privilege access to key stores, and clear rotation.

## Secure architecture and zero trust thinking

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="practice" sectionId="advanced-secure-architecture" />

Zero trust is simple: never assume the network is friendly, always verify access, limit blast radius. <GlossaryTip term="zero trust">Design where no implicit trust is granted based on network location</GlossaryTip>. <GlossaryTip term="microsegment">Breaking systems into small zones with tight policy</GlossaryTip> reduces how far an attacker can move. Defence in depth still matters: identity, network, application, and data controls should stack.

<DiagramBlock
  title="Layered, segmented view"
  subtitle="User access checked at every hop; segments limit lateral movement."
>
  <div className="text-xs sm:text-sm leading-5 space-y-2">
    <div>User → Web tier (auth + WAF) → API tier (mTLS + authZ) → Data tier (policy + encryption)</div>
    <div>Segments between tiers; inspection and logging at each boundary.</div>
    <div className="text-gray-700">Breaches should be contained to the smallest zone.</div>
  </div>
</DiagramBlock>

Patterns that help: strong identity and device posture, least privilege, service-to-service authentication, network policy that defaults to deny, explicit trust boundaries, and observability everywhere. Avoid flat networks, shared admin accounts, and hidden backdoors that bypass controls.

## Detection, response and threat hunting

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="practice" sectionId="advanced-detection-response" />

Detection closes the gap between compromise and action. A <GlossaryTip term="SIEM">platform that collects and correlates security events</GlossaryTip> feeds alerts to a <GlossaryTip term="SOC">team that monitors and responds</GlossaryTip>. Good detection reduces <GlossaryTip term="dwell time">how long an attacker stays unnoticed</GlossaryTip>. Response follows a loop: triage, contain, eradicate, recover, and learn.

Threat hunting is proactive: forming a hypothesis and looking for weak signals before an alert fires. Playbooks standardise common steps; tabletop exercises build muscle memory.

  title="From events to action"
  subtitle="Systems emit events → SIEM rules → alerts → analyst follows a playbook."

  <div className="text-xs sm:text-sm leading-5 space-y-2">

## Governance, frameworks and your career

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="practice" sectionId="advanced-governance-career" />

Governance sets who decides, how risk is measured, and how evidence is shown. <GlossaryTip term="NIST CSF">A framework organised around identify, protect, detect, respond and recover</GlossaryTip> maps well to real work. <GlossaryTip term="risk appetite">The amount of risk an organisation is willing to accept</GlossaryTip> guides control strength. <GlossaryTip term="control objective">The outcome a control should achieve, not just the control name</GlossaryTip> keeps audits meaningful.

Career paths stay wide: architecture, incident response, cloud, governance, or product security. Certs can help (CISSP, GSEC, cloud provider tracks) but practice and communication matter most.
