# Applied Cybersecurity

<LevelProgressBar courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" sectionIds={cyberSections.applied} />

<CPDTracker courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" estimatedHours={10} />

Applied is where we stop describing computers and start thinking like attackers and defenders. We keep the language human, but we anchor every idea to assets, entry points, and the controls that actually change outcomes.

## Threat modelling and attacker thinking

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" sectionId="applied-threat-modelling" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Security improves fastest when I can answer one question clearly: what matters, who might attack it, and how it could fail.
</Callout>

A threat model is a simple story about risk. I list each <GlossaryTip term="asset">something that hurts if stolen, changed, or stopped</GlossaryTip>. I name the <GlossaryTip term="threat">who or what could cause harm</GlossaryTip>. I map <GlossaryTip term="attack surface">every way they can interact with the system</GlossaryTip> and the <GlossaryTip term="trust boundary">places where assumptions change</GlossaryTip>. This keeps me focused on reality instead of memorising exotic exploits.

<DiagramBlock
  title="Small threat model in one glance"
  subtitle="People and data cross boundaries; assumptions must be explicit."
>
  <div className="text-xs sm:text-sm leading-5 space-y-2">
    <div>User → Web app → API → Database</div>
    <div className="text-gray-700">Public internet to web app is a trust boundary. API credentials and personal data are assets.</div>
    <div className="text-gray-700">Attacker pushes inputs at the web form and the API. Controls: validation, auth, logging.</div>
  </div>
</DiagramBlock>

<QuizBlock

  questions={[
    { q: "Why start with assets before attacks", a: "Assets tell you what matters, so you focus on controls that protect real value." },
    { q: "What is an attack surface", a: "All the ways an attacker can interact with the system including inputs, interfaces, and dependencies." },
    { q: "What is a trust boundary", a: "A place where assumptions change and data must be validated before it crosses." },
    { q: "Why list actors as well as threats", a: "Different actors have different motives and capabilities which change which controls work." },
    { q: "How do entry points relate to controls", a: "Each entry point should have clear validation, authentication, and monitoring tied to it." },
    { q: "What makes a threat model useful", a: "It guides where to test and where to place controls, not just a diagram for decoration." },

## Attack surfaces and common failure classes

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" sectionId="applied-attack-surfaces" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Most breaches start with what is exposed, not with exotic zero days.
</Callout>

Operating systems run services, services open ports, and apps expose inputs. The attack surface grows with every feature and every default left unchanged. Common failure classes repeat: <GlossaryTip term="injection">untrusted input treated as instructions</GlossaryTip>, broken access control, unsafe defaults, and <GlossaryTip term="vulnerability">a weakness that can be exploited</GlossaryTip> through a reachable entry point.

    <div>Browser → API → Database</div>
    <div>Inputs: login form, file upload, query parameter, admin console</div>
    <div className="text-gray-700">Each input crosses a trust boundary; validation and auth must match the risk.</div>

    { q: "Why is injection dangerous", a: "It turns untrusted input into commands understood by an interpreter." },
    { q: "What is insecure default", a: "A setting that leaves access open, uses weak credentials, or exposes sensitive debug info." },
    { q: "How does metadata leak", a: "Banners, headers and timing can reveal versions or behaviour even if content is encrypted." },
    { q: "Where should validation live", a: "At every untrusted input, server side, before data reaches interpreters or storage." },
    { q: "Why map trust boundaries when reviewing attack surface", a: "They show where assumptions change and where extra checks or isolation are needed." },

## Authentication, sessions and access control

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" sectionId="applied-auth-sessions-access" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Authentication answers who you are. Authorisation answers what you may do. Sessions remember you between requests. Mixing them up is why many breaches feel trivial.
</Callout>

A session is a bridge in a stateless world. Cookies or tokens are just carriers; their safety depends on creation, storage, expiry, rotation and server side checks. Common failures: predictable IDs, missing <GlossaryTip term="privilege escalation">checks that stop users gaining extra rights</GlossaryTip>, and replaying stolen <GlossaryTip term="token">credentials stored in cookies or headers</GlossaryTip>. Good hygiene: secure and HttpOnly cookies, short lifetimes, rotation, server side invalidation, and consistent authorisation on every request.

  subtitle="Login creates a session token that rides with each request."

  <div className="text-xs sm:text-sm leading-5 space-y-2">

  questions={[
    { q: "How do authentication and authorisation differ", a: "Authentication proves identity; authorisation decides what that identity may do." },
    { q: "Why are secure and HttpOnly flags important", a: "They reduce theft by limiting script access and forcing transport security." },
    { q: "What breaks when you skip authorisation", a: "Users can access data or actions they should not, even if they logged in correctly." },
    { q: "How does session rotation help", a: "It invalidates old tokens so stolen tokens are less useful." },
    { q: "Name one sign of privilege escalation", a: "A normal user invoking an admin-only action without being stopped." },
    { q: "What should happen on logout", a: "Server side invalidation of the token or session so reuse fails." },

## Logging, monitoring and risk thinking

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="cybersecurity" levelId="applied" sectionId="applied-logging-and-risk" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Prevention is never perfect. Good detection shortens the time between a bad action and your response.
</Callout>

I log what I fear: authentication, authorisation, sensitive access, privilege changes, unusual network patterns. A <GlossaryTip term="log">record of what happened</GlossaryTip> is only useful when it becomes a <GlossaryTip term="signal">something that indicates risk</GlossaryTip> that can turn into an <GlossaryTip term="alert">actionable notification to a human or system</GlossaryTip>. Risk thinking joins likelihood and impact; controls reduce one or both but add cost and friction.

    { q: "Why do too many alerts hurt", a: "Alert fatigue hides real incidents because people start to ignore them." },
    { q: "How does likelihood differ from impact", a: "Likelihood is how often it may happen; impact is how bad it is when it does." },
    { q: "What is residual risk", a: "The risk that remains after controls are applied." },
    { q: "Who owns responding to alerts", a: "A named person or team so responsibility is clear." },
