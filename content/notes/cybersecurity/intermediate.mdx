# Cybersecurity Notes  
## Intermediate  
### How systems fail and how we defend them

<Callout variant="concept">
Beginner taught me what data is, how meaning is constructed, what CIA means, and why networks and trust boundaries matter. Intermediate is where I switch to real attacker and defender thinking. I stop asking what a system is and start asking what it can be made to do under pressure.

## 1. Threat modelling and attacker thinking

<Callout variant="concept">
Security improves fastest when I can answer one question clearly. What am I protecting, from whom, and how could it fail.
</Callout>

### A simple story first
Imagine a house. If I only buy stronger locks, but leave the back window open, I did not become safer. I became confident in the wrong place.

Systems are the same. Threat modelling is how I stop guessing.

<GlossaryTip term="Threat modelling">
Threat modelling is a structured way to describe assets, attackers, attack surfaces, trust boundaries, assumptions, and controls so security decisions are deliberate rather than emotional.
</GlossaryTip>

### What is an asset
An asset is anything that matters if it is stolen, changed, or made unavailable.

Beginner talked about CIA properties. In threat modelling I attach those properties to specific things.

Examples:
- user credentials and session tokens
- personal data
- money and payment workflows
- system availability for critical services
- reputation and integrity of published content

<GlossaryTip term="Asset">
An asset is anything valuable that requires protection, including data, functionality, availability, or trust.
</GlossaryTip>

### Who is the attacker
People imagine a magical hacker. I prefer to think in attacker categories because each category has different capability.

Examples:
- curious user
- disgruntled insider
- opportunistic criminal
- targeted attacker
- automated scanning bots

<GlossaryTip term="Threat actor">
A threat actor is the person or group that may attack a system, including their motivation and capability.
</GlossaryTip>

### Attack surface, entry points, and trust boundaries
Beginner introduced trust boundaries. In threat modelling, I use them deliberately.

- an entry point is where data or control enters a system
- an attack surface is the sum of all entry points
- a trust boundary is where assumptions change

<GlossaryTip term="Attack surface">
Attack surface is the total set of ways an attacker can interact with a system, including inputs, interfaces, users, and dependencies.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="Entry point">
An entry point is a specific location where data or actions enter a component, such as a login form, API endpoint, file upload, or admin console.
</GlossaryTip>

### Why modelling matters more than memorising attacks
A good threat model turns scary unknowns into checklists:
- what can be abused
- what data is exposed
- what failure would be catastrophic
- what controls reduce the probability or impact

### Practice: map a threat scenario

## 2. Attack surfaces and common failure classes

<Callout variant="concept">
Most security failures are not fancy. They are predictable outcomes of unvalidated input, incorrect assumptions, and confusing identity with permission.
</Callout>

### Complexity is the hidden enemy
A system becomes less secure as it becomes harder to reason about. More features means more entry points. More dependencies means more trust relationships. More integration means more assumptions.

In practice, an attacker does not need to break everything. They only need one place where the system trusts the wrong thing.

### Failure class  injection
Injection happens when a system treats user input as instructions.

Start with the simplest example. A search box should be data. If the system accidentally treats it as commands, the attacker controls behaviour.

<GlossaryTip term="Injection">
Injection is when untrusted input is interpreted as code or instructions inside another interpreter, such as SQL, HTML, shell commands, or templates.
</GlossaryTip>

The core beginner link is interpretation. Beginner taught that bit patterns are meaningless until interpreted. Injection is malicious interpretation.

### Failure class  broken access control
This is when a system lets a user do something they should not.

It can happen even if authentication is perfect.

<GlossaryTip term="Access control">
Access control is the enforcement of who can do what to which resource under which conditions.
</GlossaryTip>

### Failure class  insecure defaults
Default settings are often designed for convenience, not safety. If a system is safe only after perfect configuration, then the system is unsafe.

<GlossaryTip term="Secure by default">
Secure by default means the safest configuration is the starting configuration, not an optional extra.
</GlossaryTip>

    { q: "Why is injection linked to Beginner encoding and interpretation", a: "Because security failures occur when systems interpret the same data differently or treat it as commands." },
    { q: "What is broken access control", a: "When the system allows actions that should be forbidden, even if identity is correct." },
    { q: "Why do insecure defaults matter", a: "Because most people do not configure perfectly, so insecure defaults become real-world vulnerabilities." },
    { q: "What is secure by default", a: "The system starts in the safest configuration without extra steps." }

## 3. Authentication, sessions, and identity

<Callout variant="concept">
Authentication answers who you are. Authorisation answers what you are allowed to do. Sessions answer how the system remembers you between requests.
</Callout>

### Why sessions exist
On the web, many interactions are stateless. A server receives a request, returns a response, and forgets. But users expect continuity. Sessions provide continuity.

<GlossaryTip term="Session">
A session is a server side or token based mechanism that links multiple requests to the same user over time.
</GlossaryTip>

### Cookies and tokens in plain terms
A cookie is a small piece of data the browser stores and sends back automatically.

A token is a proof the client presents to the server.

These are not inherently secure or insecure. Security depends on how they are created, protected, expired, and validated.

<GlossaryTip term="Token">
A token is a piece of data used to prove identity or permission, often time limited and signed.
</GlossaryTip>

### How sessions fail in real life
Common failure modes:
- predictable session identifiers
- tokens stored unsafely
- long-lived tokens that never expire
- missing checks for privilege changes
- session fixation where attacker sets a session before login
- session hijacking where attacker steals a session after login

Beginner trust boundaries appear again. The browser is not trusted. The network is not trusted. Any stored credential must be treated as a target.

## 4. Cryptography foundations for defenders

<Callout variant="concept">
Cryptography is a toolbox for confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. It is powerful, but it is not magic. It does not replace correct system design.
</Callout>

### Hashing versus encryption versus encoding
Beginner warned against mixing these up. Here I make the separation sharper.

- Encoding changes representation for compatibility
- Hashing produces a fixed-size fingerprint
- Encryption transforms data so only key holders can recover it

<GlossaryTip term="Hash">
A hash is a one way function that maps input data to a fixed size fingerprint, designed so small input changes produce very different outputs.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="Encryption">
Encryption is a reversible transformation that hides content, so only those with the key can recover the original data.
</GlossaryTip>

### Why hashing exists
Hashing is used for:
- integrity checking
- password storage, when combined with salt and slow hashing
- digital signatures, where hashes represent large messages

### Salt and why it matters
A salt is random data added to passwords before hashing. It prevents precomputed attacks against many identical passwords.

<GlossaryTip term="Salt">
A salt is random data combined with a password before hashing to ensure the same password does not always produce the same hash.
</GlossaryTip>

### Symmetric and asymmetric intuition
Symmetric encryption uses one key for encrypt and decrypt. Asymmetric uses a pair: public key and private key.

At intermediate level, the core idea is what each is good for:
- symmetric is fast for bulk data
- asymmetric supports identity and key exchange

<QuizBlock
  title="Cryptography foundations check"
  questions={[
    { q: "What is the difference between hashing and encryption", a: "Hashing is one way and produces a fingerprint. Encryption is reversible with a key." },
    { q: "Why is encoding not security", a: "Encoding is designed to be reversible using public rules, so it does not hide meaning from attackers." },
    { q: "Why do we add salt to password hashing", a: "To prevent identical passwords producing identical hashes and to block precomputed attacks." },
    { q: "What is symmetric encryption good for", a: "Fast encryption of large amounts of data." },
    { q: "What is asymmetric cryptography good for", a: "Identity, signatures, and securely exchanging keys." },
    { q: "Why does cryptography not fix poor design", a: "Because attackers can bypass cryptography through access control failures, session theft, or misuse of trust." }

## 5. Logging, monitoring, and detection

<Callout variant="concept">
If prevention was perfect, detection would not matter. Prevention is never perfect. Detection is how I shorten time to discovery.
</Callout>

### Logs are not just records
Logs are signals. Signals must be:
- reliable
- contextual
- actionable

If a system logs everything, it logs nothing. I drown in noise.

<GlossaryTip term="Signal to noise">
Signal to noise describes how much useful information exists relative to irrelevant activity. Good detection maximises signal, not volume.
</GlossaryTip>

### What I log depends on what I fear
Threat modelling returns here. If I do not know my likely failures, I cannot decide what to monitor.

Good logs often include:
- authentication events
- authorisation decisions
- privilege changes
- sensitive data access
- unusual network patterns

### Practice tool  build detection signals

<QuizBlock
  title="Detection thinking check"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why is detection a first class control", a: "Because breaches can occur despite prevention, and detection reduces time to damage." },
    { q: "Why is logging everything not always helpful", a: "It reduces signal to noise and creates alert fatigue." },
    { q: "What is alert fatigue", a: "When too many low quality alerts cause real threats to be missed." },
    { q: "How does threat modelling inform logging", a: "It identifies likely failure modes, which determines what signals matter." },
    { q: "What is an actionable signal", a: "A signal with enough context that an engineer can respond decisively." },
    { q: "What security events should be logged first", a: "Authentication, authorisation, privilege changes, and sensitive resource access." }

## 6. Risk thinking and trade-offs

<Callout variant="concept">
Security is not about removing all risk. It is about reducing risk to an acceptable level and being honest about what remains.
</Callout>

### Risk in simple terms
Risk is a combination of:
- how likely something is
- how bad it would be if it happens

A simple model is:

\[
Risk = Likelihood \times Impact
\]

This is not the only model, but it is a useful starter. It forces a basic discipline. If I cannot describe likelihood or impact, I cannot prioritise.

<GlossaryTip term="Likelihood">
Likelihood is how probable an event is, based on exposure, attacker incentives, and system weakness.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="Impact">
Impact is the severity of harm if an event occurs, including financial, operational, legal, safety, and reputational harm.
</GlossaryTip>

### Trade-offs are unavoidable
Controls create cost:
- developer time
- latency and performance cost
- user friction
- operational complexity

Some controls increase security while also increasing new failure modes. Intermediate security is learning to see both sides.

  questions={[
    { q: "Why can I not remove all risk", a: "Because systems are complex, attackers adapt, and controls introduce cost and new failure modes." },
    { q: "What does the formula Risk = Likelihood x Impact help with", a: "Prioritising by forcing explicit judgement about probability and severity." },
    { q: "What is residual risk", a: "Risk that remains after controls are applied and must be accepted or mitigated further." },
    { q: "Why can security controls increase risk", a: "They add complexity, dependencies, and new failure paths." },
    { q: "What is an example of a trade-off", a: "More logging improves detection but can increase privacy risk and operational noise." },
    { q: "How does this prepare for Advanced", a: "Advanced focuses on defensible architecture decisions and operational realism under constraints." }
