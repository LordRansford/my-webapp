# Software Architecture Notes - Beginner

<LevelProgressBar courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionIds={softwareArchitectureSectionManifest.foundations} />

<CPDTracker courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" estimatedHours={10} />

I wrote these notes because most failures I have seen were not one bad function but unclear purpose, porous boundaries, and decisions that became too expensive to change. The goal here is to see systems as a whole, not just code.

## Why software architecture exists

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionId="sa-foundations-what-is-architecture" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Architecture exists to manage complexity over time and keep change affordable.
</Callout>

Systems rot when responsibilities blur, boundaries leak, and decisions drift. Architecture is the discipline of making the hard-to-change decisions explicit: how to split the system, where to place responsibility, how to communicate, and what to optimise for.

If changing a choice would force many teams to rewrite code, it is almost always an architectural decision.

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - purpose"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why do most systems fail", a: "Because structure, responsibilities, and constraints were unclear, making change expensive." },
    { q: "What makes a decision architectural", a: "It is costly to change and affects multiple parts of the system." },
    { q: "Why is architecture about time", a: "It keeps the system adaptable as requirements and environment change." },

## What is a system

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionId="sa-foundations-building-blocks" />

<Callout variant="concept">
A system is parts plus purpose plus constraints.
</Callout>

A system has components, interactions, constraints, and an environment. Without a clear purpose, there is no system to design. In software this usually means users, interfaces, services, data stores, external systems, and the people operating them.

<GlossaryTip term="System">
Plain: Interacting parts organised to achieve a purpose under constraints.  
Formal: A bounded set of components whose interactions produce observable behaviour toward a goal.
</GlossaryTip>

Purpose drives structure. If the purpose shifts, architecture must respond or it will decay.

## What software architecture is and is not

<Callout variant="concept">
Architecture is structure and principles for hard-to-change decisions, not low-level details.
</Callout>

Architecture is how the system is decomposed, how responsibilities are placed, how components interact, and which qualities matter most. Architecture is not variable names, individual algorithms, or screen layouts. Those matter, but they live inside the structure.

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - definition"
  questions={[
    { q: "What is software architecture", a: "The fundamental structure of a system, its components, relationships, and guiding principles." },
    { q: "What is not architecture", a: "Low-level code details like variable names or single functions." },
  ]}
/>

---

## Structure, components, and boundaries

<Callout variant="concept">
Boundaries fail quietly. Good architecture makes them explicit.
</Callout>

Structure answers: what are the major parts, what each part owns, and what is allowed to change. A component is a unit of responsibility: a module, service, or external system. A boundary defines responsibility, knowledge limits, allowed interactions, and change impact.

<GlossaryTip term="Boundary">
Plain: A separation that limits how components interact and change.  
Formal: A defined interface and responsibility line that constrains coupling and change propagation.
</GlossaryTip>

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - structure"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why are boundaries central to architecture", a: "They control coupling, change impact, and clarity of responsibility." },
    { q: "What happens when boundaries are fuzzy", a: "Responsibilities bleed, changes ripple unpredictably, and the system becomes fragile." },
  ]}
/>

## Quality attributes and constraints

<Callout variant="concept">
Quality attributes shape structure more than features do.
</Callout>

Performance, security, availability, scalability, maintainability, and reliability are quality attributes. They decide the structure more than individual features. Constraints such as regulation, budget, legacy systems, and team structure limit what is possible. Architecture is about making good decisions within these limits.

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - qualities"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why do quality attributes matter", a: "They cross-cut the system and dictate structural choices." },
    { q: "Why do constraints matter", a: "They limit options and make trade-offs explicit." },
  ]}
/>

---

## Trade-offs and architectural decisions

<Callout variant="concept">
Every architectural decision is a trade-off. Be explicit.
</Callout>

Simplicity versus flexibility, consistency versus availability, speed of delivery versus maintainability. None are universally correct; they must align with purpose. Document the trade-off, the reason, and the expected review point.

<GlossaryTip term="Trade-off">
Plain: Improving one quality at the cost of another.  
Formal: A decision where optimising one attribute degrades another due to shared constraints.
</GlossaryTip>

<ToolCard title="&#9881; Explore trade-offs visually">
  <TradeoffExplorer />
</ToolCard>

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - trade-offs"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why document trade-offs", a: "So future teams understand intent and can revisit decisions consciously." },
    { q: "Give an example trade-off", a: "Higher availability often adds operational cost and complexity." },
  ]}
/>

## Architecture as a living discipline

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionId="sa-foundations-diagrams-and-views" />

<Callout variant="concept">
Architecture evolves. Stasis is decay.
</Callout>

Systems, requirements, and organisations change. Good architecture is revisited regularly, documented lightly, and improved deliberately. Bad architecture assumes decisions are permanent and ignores drift.

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - evolution"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why revisit architecture", a: "To align with changing purpose, constraints, and environment." },
    { q: "What is a sign of decay", a: "Teams work around the architecture rather than with it." },
  ]}
/>

## Observing systems in practice

<Callout variant="concept">
If you cannot observe a system, you cannot govern or improve it.
</Callout>

Observation reveals load behaviour, bottlenecks, and failures. It validates assumptions. Architecture that ignores observability is incomplete.

<ToolCard title="&#128300; Quick architecture lens">
  <SystemDashboard />
</ToolCard>

<QuizBlock
  title="Check your understanding - observation"
  questions={[
    { q: "Why is observability part of architecture", a: "It ensures behaviour can be seen, validated, and adjusted." },
  ]}
/>

## Practice and reflection

<QuizBlock
  title="Final check - foundations"
  questions={[
    { q: "What makes architecture different from design details", a: "It governs structure and decisions that are hard to change." },
    { q: "Why do boundaries matter most", a: "They define ownership, limit coupling, and control change impact." },
    { q: "How do quality attributes shape design", a: "They force structural choices to satisfy performance, security, availability, and more." },
    { q: "Why must architecture evolve", a: "Purpose and constraints change; architecture must adapt to stay useful." },
  ]}
