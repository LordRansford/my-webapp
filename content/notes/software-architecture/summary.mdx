# Software Architecture Notes - Summary

This page ties together the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced pages. It is lighter, more visual, and more playful, but still serious. The goal is to consolidate, test understanding, and invite exploration.

## What you should now understand

If you have worked through the earlier pages, you should have a coherent mental model of architecture: purpose, structure, boundaries, quality attributes, trade-offs, organisational impact, resilience, and governance.

<Callout variant="concept">
If you can explain architecture without naming a framework or tool, you understand it.
</Callout>

## Architecture as thinking

Architecture is not a deliverable. It is a way of thinking: slowing down, asking what will change, who is affected, what assumptions are hidden, and how failure will occur.

<GlossaryTip term="Architectural thinking">
Plain: Reasoning about systems, trade-offs, and long-term consequences.  
Formal: A discipline of evaluating structure, qualities, and risk to guide sustainable system evolution.
</GlossaryTip>

## Dashboards and system signals

Architecture must be observable. These dashboards simulate how architects reason about live systems.

### Architecture health dashboard

<ArchitectureDashboard />

### Decision and change dashboard

<DecisionDashboard />

### Digitalisation and delivery dashboard

<DigitalisationDashboard />

<Callout variant="concept">
If you cannot see the system, you cannot steer it.
</Callout>

## Reflection and next steps

Ask yourself:
- Where do I see architectural problems in systems I know
- What decisions would I revisit with this understanding
- How would I explain architecture to a non-technical leader
- What trade-offs am I currently ignoring

<QuizBlock
  questions={[
    {
      q: "What distinguishes architecture from design and implementation?",
      a: "Architecture focuses on decisions that shape structure and are costly to change.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why are trade-offs unavoidable in architecture?",
      a: "Because improving one quality attribute often degrades another.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why must architecture be observable?",
      a: "Because unobserved systems cannot be understood or improved.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the architect ultimately responsible for?",
      a: "The long-term health and adaptability of the system.",
    },
