<BodyText>
  This page moves from understanding structure to designing real systems. The goal now is to turn quality goals and constraints into a structure that people can build and change safely. The rhythm stays the same as the beginner page: context first, definition second, practice and reflection always.

  From understanding to design
</SectionHeader>

Designing architecture means

1. Turning requirements into structure
2. Translating quality attributes into constraints
3. Making decisions with incomplete information
4. Accepting trade offs explicitly

Architecture design is not about finding the perfect answer. It is about finding a **good enough structure** that serves its purpose and can evolve.

<Callout variant="concept">
Architecture design is the act of making informed trade offs under uncertainty.
</Callout>

  Architectural styles and patterns
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="applied" sectionId="sa-intermediate-architectural-styles" />

An **architectural style** is a named way of organising a system that reflects common solutions to recurring problems.

Styles are not rules. They are starting points. Some emphasise simplicity, others scalability, autonomy, or resilience. No style is universally correct.

Common styles include layered systems, client-server systems, microservices, and event-driven systems.

<GlossaryTip term="Architectural style">
A recurring structural pattern that shapes how a system is organised and how components interact.
</GlossaryTip>

Choosing a style is architectural because it influences how the system evolves, how teams work, how failures propagate, and how easy the system is to reason about.

  Decomposition and responsibility
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="applied" sectionId="sa-intermediate-microservices-and-integration" />

Decomposition is the process of breaking a system into parts. Good decomposition is the difference between a system that scales and one that collapses under its own weight.

Focus on

1. Grouping related responsibilities
2. Minimising unnecessary coupling
3. Aligning components with real world concepts

Poor decomposition often comes from technical convenience, copying existing systems blindly, or organisational pressure instead of design reasoning.

<Callout variant="concept">
Decomposition should follow responsibility, not technology.
</Callout>

A quick test. If a component has more than one reason to change, its boundary is probably wrong.

  Quality-driven architecture
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="applied" sectionId="sa-intermediate-runtime-tradeoffs" />

In real systems, architecture is driven by **quality attributes** more than features.

Performance influences concurrency and caching. Security influences trust boundaries and data flow. Availability influences redundancy and failure handling.

Architectural design maps quality attributes, constraints, and risks into structural decisions.

<GlossaryTip term="Quality attribute">
A measurable property describing how a system behaves under load, failure, or change.
</GlossaryTip>

Ignoring quality attributes early leads to expensive redesign later.

  Making and recording decisions
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="applied" sectionId="sa-intermediate-cqrs-event-sourcing" />

Architecture is a decision-making discipline. Each decision has context, options, trade-offs, and consequences.

Good architects do not try to remember everything. They **record** important choices.

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures the decision, why it was made, rejected alternatives, and consequences.

<Callout variant="concept">
Undocumented decisions become hidden assumptions.
</Callout>

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="📚" id="documentation-views">
  Documentation and architectural views
</SectionHeader>

Architecture must be communicated clearly. One diagram is never enough.

Different stakeholders need different views

1. Business stakeholders need context
2. Developers need structure
3. Operators need deployment and runtime views

Effective documentation uses multiple views rather than one complex diagram. Show only what the reader needs, hide unnecessary detail, and make assumptions explicit.

<Callout variant="concept">
Architecture diagrams exist to support understanding, not decoration.
</Callout>

  questions={[
    {
      q: "Why is architectural design fundamentally about trade-offs?",
      a: "Because improving one quality attribute usually degrades another."
    },
    {
      q: "Why should decomposition follow responsibility rather than technology?",
      a: "Because responsibilities change more slowly and align better with system intent."
    },
    {
      q: "Why are architectural decisions recorded?",
      a: "To preserve reasoning and prevent hidden assumptions."
    },
    {
      q: "Why are multiple architectural views necessary?",
      a: "Because different stakeholders need different levels of detail."
