# Progression map  
## How I move from beginner to expert

I designed these notes to be read like a story. Each level assumes the previous one. I focus on mental models, then practise, then real-world application.

## Beginner  Foundations
Link: /notes/cybersecurity/beginner

You learn what data is, how meaning is constructed, what security properties are, and how networks move data. You practise with calm in-browser tools.

Outcomes:
- explain data, encoding, trust, CIA, networks
- understand why security begins before encryption
- feel ready for attacker thinking

## Intermediate  Attacker and defender thinking
Link: /notes/cybersecurity/intermediate

Topics I will cover:
- threat modelling and attack surfaces
- authentication systems and sessions
- access control models including RBAC and ABAC
- web security and injection classes
- network security basics, DNS, TLS high-level
- secure software habits and logging

Outcomes:
- identify threats and controls systematically
- understand how common attacks work and why
- build intuition for secure design and trade-offs

## Advanced  Engineering security in real systems
Link: /notes/cybersecurity/advanced

Topics I will cover:
- applied cryptography and protocols
- PKI, certificates, key lifecycle
- secure architecture patterns and zero trust
- detection and response, SOC thinking
- cloud security and identity-centric defence
- secure supply chain and software updates

Outcomes:
- reason about real systems under adversarial pressure
- evaluate controls using risk and evidence
- design robust systems and validate assumptions

## Optional professional track  Practitioner style
Later, if needed, I may add a Practitioner track that maps to professional exam domains and job roles while remaining grounded in real engineering and ethical practice.
