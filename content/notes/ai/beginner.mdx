## What AI is and why it matters now

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🧠" id="what-is-ai">
  What AI is and why it matters now
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="foundations" sectionId="ai-foundations-what-is-ai" />

<Callout variant="concept">
AI is a way of learning patterns from data so a system can make predictions, rank options, or automate decisions.
</Callout>

When people say AI, they often mean a system that takes input, applies a learned pattern, and produces an output. The learned pattern is the <GlossaryTip term="model">A function learned from data that maps inputs to outputs.</GlossaryTip>. The act of learning that pattern is <GlossaryTip term="training">The process of fitting a model to data so it can learn patterns.</GlossaryTip>. Using the trained model to produce results is <GlossaryTip term="inference">Running a trained model to produce predictions on new inputs.</GlossaryTip>.

The difference between training and inference matters because the risks are different. Training is where you bake in assumptions from the <GlossaryTip term="dataset">A collection of examples used to train and evaluate a model.</GlossaryTip>. Inference is where the model meets reality. If reality changes, the model can behave badly even if training looked perfect.

AI is powerful because it can learn patterns too complex to write as hand made rules. It is also fragile because it can learn the wrong pattern. A model can look clever while failing quietly. The skill is to ask what it is really using as evidence.

AI matters now because systems touch decisions that used to be manual. Hiring screens, fraud checks, support routing, and medical triage all use models to move faster. That speed is useful, but it can also amplify mistakes at scale. This is why foundations matter. I need to know what the model is doing before I trust it.

Imagine a support team that uses an AI model to route urgent messages. If the model learns that certain phrases usually mean “urgent”, it may quietly miss urgent messages written in a different style. The risk is not only wrong answers. The risk is wrong priorities at speed.

In practice, the first useful question is “What happens on the model’s bad day?” If the answer is “we do not know”, the system is not ready to be trusted for anything high impact.

My calm view on hype is this. AI is not magic. It is applied statistics plus engineering. It will keep changing how work is done, and it will keep producing failures that look silly in hindsight. If you learn the basics, you can use it well without believing the marketing.

## Data and representation

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="📊" id="data-and-representation">
  Data and representation
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="foundations" sectionId="ai-foundations-data-and-representation" />

In AI, the word <GlossaryTip term="data">
Data is recorded observations about the world. It is what the model learns from, not what we wish was true.
</GlossaryTip> sounds fancy, but it is usually boring. It is clicks, purchases, support tickets, photos, sensor readings, and text. Data always comes with context. Where did it come from. Who produced it. What is missing. What was measured badly. If you ignore that, you build a confident model on shaky ground.

Some data is structured. That means it fits neatly into rows and columns. Think customer age, number of failed logins, or time since last password reset. Other data is unstructured. That means it looks like raw text, images, audio, or long logs. It still has structure, but you have to extract it.

To train a model, we usually separate inputs from the answer we want. A <GlossaryTip term="feature">
A feature is a measurable piece of information about something. For example the length of an email or the number of failed login attempts.
</GlossaryTip> is an input signal. A <GlossaryTip term="label">
A label is the correct answer for training. For example spam or not spam, or refund needed or not.
</GlossaryTip> is the outcome we want the model to learn to predict.

Models cannot understand raw text or images the way humans do. They do not see meaning. They see numbers. If you give a model a photo, it will be turned into numbers first. If you give it an email, it will be turned into numbers first. The model learns patterns in those numbers.

The simplest numeric form is a <GlossaryTip term="vector">
A vector is a list of numbers that represents an input. The numbers are chosen so the model can work with them.
</GlossaryTip>. For text, we first break it into a <GlossaryTip term="token">
A token is a small chunk of text used as the unit for language models. It might be a word or part of a word.
</GlossaryTip>. Then we map those tokens into an <GlossaryTip term="embedding">
An embedding is a numeric vector that tries to place similar items near each other in number space.
</GlossaryTip>.

The intuition is simple. If two pieces of text are used in similar ways, they often end up with similar numbers. A model can then treat closeness as a hint that the meaning is related. It is not perfect. It is a useful shortcut.

In a real system, representation choices show up as behaviour. If you represent a customer only by “spend last month”, the model may miss that a loyal customer is having a temporary issue. If you represent them by richer behaviour signals, the model may be more useful but also harder to explain.

Suppose you build a model using “postcode” as a feature because it predicts outcomes well. In practice, that can become a proxy for protected attributes. The representation can silently encode social patterns you did not intend to automate.

Bad data creates bad models. If the labels are wrong, the model learns the wrong lesson. If the data is missing whole groups of people, the model will fail on those groups. If the data reflects old behaviour, the model will struggle when the world changes. This is why data work is not busywork. It is the foundation.

Splitting data matters because we want honest feedback. Training data is what the model learns from. Validation data is what you use to make choices during building. Test data is the final check you keep separate until the end. If you test on the same data you trained on, you are grading your own homework with the answer sheet open.

## Supervised and unsupervised learning

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🎓" id="learning-paradigms">
  Supervised and unsupervised learning
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="foundations" sectionId="ai-foundations-learning-paradigms" />

When we say a model learns, we mean it changes its internal settings so it can make better guesses. It is not learning like a person learns. It is closer to practice. You show examples, it adjusts, and it gets less wrong over time.

<GlossaryTip term="training data">
Training data is the set of examples you use to teach the model. It is the practice material, not the final exam.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="supervised learning">
Supervised learning is when a model learns using examples that already have the correct answer attached.
</GlossaryTip>

In supervised learning, you give the model an input and an answer. The model tries to guess the answer, then it is corrected. Over many examples, it learns a pattern that can generalise to new cases.

Email spam filtering is a classic supervised example. You have emails, and you have labels like spam and not spam. Image classification is another. You have images, and you have labels like cat, dog, or receipt. House prices are supervised too, but the answer is a number. The same pattern applies. Inputs in, answer attached, model learns to predict.

There are two common supervised shapes.

<GlossaryTip term="classification">
Classification is predicting a category. For example spam or not spam.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="regression">
Regression is predicting a number. For example a house price.
</GlossaryTip>

The difference matters because the mistakes feel different. A wrong category can block a real email. A wrong price can cost real money.

<GlossaryTip term="unsupervised learning">
Unsupervised learning is when a model looks for structure in data without being told the correct answers.
</GlossaryTip>

Instead of asking "what is the right label", you ask "what patterns exist". This is useful when labels are missing, expensive, or not even well defined.

Grouping customers by behaviour is a common unsupervised example. You might discover that one group buys weekly and another group buys once a year. Topic discovery in documents is another. You might find clusters of themes in support tickets without anyone labelling them by hand. Anomaly detection is a third. You look for unusual behaviour that might signal fraud or intrusion.

Unsupervised learning is harder to evaluate because there is no single correct answer waiting in a spreadsheet. If you change your settings, the groupings can change. Sometimes both results are reasonable. You have to judge usefulness, not just score points.

Imagine a bank clustering transactions to find “normal” behaviour. If the system learns that weekend spending is “unusual” for a certain group, it might flag normal customers as fraud. Unsupervised results still need human judgement and context.

In practice, teams use clustering to create segments and then make decisions based on those segments. That means errors in the clustering can become policy, pricing, or access decisions. Treat cluster labels as hypotheses, not truth.

Here are a few beginner misconceptions to avoid. First, more data is not always better data. If it is biased or messy, you scale the problem. Second, unsupervised learning is not a free shortcut. It still needs careful interpretation. Third, a model learning a pattern does not mean it understands a reason. It means it found a shortcut that worked on the training data.

## Responsible AI basics and limitations

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="⚖️" id="responsible-ai">
  Responsible AI basics and limitations
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="foundations" sectionId="ai-foundations-responsible-ai-basics" />

AI systems can cause harm even when everybody is trying to do the right thing. The harm is not always dramatic. Sometimes it is quiet and personal. Someone is incorrectly flagged as suspicious. Someone does not get offered an opportunity. Someone is pushed into a bubble of content that makes them angrier and more certain.

The core reason is simple. Models learn patterns, not truth. They learn what tends to follow what in the data they were given. They do not know what is fair. They do not know what is lawful. They do not know what is kind. They only know what was rewarded during training.

<GlossaryTip term="bias">
Bias is when a system consistently produces unfair or skewed outcomes because of the data or assumptions it was built on.
</GlossaryTip>

Bias can enter through the data, through the labels, and through the choices we make. If your training data under represents some faces, facial recognition errors show up first in those groups. If your labels reflect past human decisions, you teach the model those decisions as if they were objective truth. If you optimise only for speed, you often trade away care.

In a real system, a “small” bias can become a big harm because automation runs every day. Imagine an AI triage tool that consistently underestimates risk for one group. Even if the average performance looks fine, the harm concentrates on real people.

In practice, the fix is not only better metrics. The fix is process: clear accountability, human review for high impact cases, and monitoring that triggers action when outcomes drift or complaints rise.

<GlossaryTip term="fairness">
Fairness is the practice of reducing avoidable harm across groups and being able to justify outcomes.
</GlossaryTip>

Fairness is not a single magic number. It is a set of decisions. What harm do we want to prevent. Which groups matter in this context. What trade offs are acceptable. It belongs with humans, not only with metrics.

<GlossaryTip term="explainability">
Explainability is the ability to give a clear, human understandable reason for why a model produced an output.
</GlossaryTip>

Explainability matters most when decisions affect real lives. An automated decision system that cannot explain itself becomes hard to challenge. People then learn to distrust the whole process, or worse, they stop trying to challenge it at all.

Bigger models do not automatically mean better or safer. They can be more capable and still be more confusing. They can also be more expensive to run, which encourages shortcuts. If it costs too much to monitor and evaluate, teams quietly stop doing it.

<SubsectionHeader emoji="🎯">
  What this optimises for
</SubsectionHeader>

1. Automation speed and consistency for low risk tasks
2. Scaled assistance when humans have time and context

<SubsectionHeader emoji="⚠️">
  What this makes harder
</SubsectionHeader>

1. Accountability if oversight is vague
2. Safe rollback when models drift or fail

AI confidence is not the same as correctness. A model can be very confident and still be wrong. This shows up most painfully when people over trust AI answers. A model that sounds fluent can still invent details. It is good at sounding plausible. It is not automatically good at being true.

<GlossaryTip term="hallucination">
A hallucination is a confident answer that is not grounded in the input or reality.
</GlossaryTip>

This is why human judgement must stay in control. Use AI to help you think, draft, or explore. Do not let it quietly become the decision maker for high impact outcomes. If a system can deny a benefit, flag a person, or change a life, it needs clear oversight and a way to appeal.

<GlossaryTip term="model drift">
Model drift is when real world data changes over time so the model performs worse than it did during evaluation.
</GlossaryTip>

Drift is not rare. It is normal. People change behaviour. Fraud patterns adapt. Language evolves. Even a simple recommendation system can drift into a bubble because the system is changing the data it then learns from. You cannot evaluate once and declare victory.
