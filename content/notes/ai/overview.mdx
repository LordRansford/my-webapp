The track stays in simple sentences while building serious skills. Use the levels below as a checklist or jump straight to the labs if you want to test a hunch.

## Levels and routes

## How to use this track

- Move through the four levels in order, or dip into a section you need for work right now.
- Record a few minutes when you practise so CPD stays honest and local to your browser.
- Share the labs with friends or a class and compare answers before you peek at mine.
- Keep notes on what surprised you; that is where the real learning hides.
