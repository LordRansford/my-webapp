  This level is about working AI, not just knowing definitions. I focus on the everyday workflows people use to get useful results while keeping control over quality and risk.

  Prompts and patterns
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="ai-intermediate-prompts-and-patterns" />

Prompts are not magic, they are instructions. A <GlossaryTip term="prompt">The instruction or input you give a model to get a response.</GlossaryTip> works best when it is clear about the task, the format, and the boundaries. A <GlossaryTip term="system prompt">A higher level instruction that sets the role, rules, and tone for the model.</GlossaryTip> should be stable and reviewed, not improvised in production.

Few shot prompts work because they show the model examples of what you expect. If the examples are sloppy, the output will be sloppy. I keep prompts short, specific, and test them like any other interface.

  Embeddings and vector search
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="ai-intermediate-embeddings-and-search" />

Embeddings turn text, images, or audio into numeric vectors. A <GlossaryTip term="embedding">A numeric representation that keeps some meaning so similar items are close together.</GlossaryTip> lets me compare ideas by distance. A <GlossaryTip term="vector store">A specialised database for storing vectors and searching them by similarity.</GlossaryTip> powers semantic search, recommendation, and clustering.

Vector search is useful because it finds meaning, not just exact words. It also adds responsibility. Bad embeddings, bad data, or bad indexing will surface the wrong information with confidence.

  Retrieval with your own documents
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="ai-intermediate-rag-with-docs" />

Retrieval augmented generation, often called RAG, lets a model answer using your documents. It works by chunking documents, embedding the chunks, and retrieving the best matches for a query. The model then answers using the retrieved context.

I watch the <GlossaryTip term="context window">The amount of text the model can consider in one response.</GlossaryTip>. If I overload it, answers degrade. I also check retrieval quality. A <GlossaryTip term="retrieval">Fetching the most relevant chunks for a query.</GlossaryTip> that is wrong leads to confident wrong answers.

<SectionHeader variant="content" emoji="🤖" id="simple-agents">
  Simple agents that use tools
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="ai-intermediate-simple-agents" />

An <GlossaryTip term="agent">A model that plans a sequence of steps and can call tools to reach a goal.</GlossaryTip> is useful for multi step tasks, but it needs guardrails. A <GlossaryTip term="tool call">A request from the model to run a function or external action.</GlossaryTip> should be limited, logged, and reviewed when risk is high.

I keep agents small and task focused. I avoid giving them wide permissions. If a task is simple, a single prompt is safer. Agents are most useful when they can use a few safe tools and stop when the goal is met.
