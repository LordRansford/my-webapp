# Engagement and assessment evidence

Quizzes test understanding and prompt reflection rather than rote recall. Interactive tools simulate real world decision making with safe inputs. Dashboards allow experimentation with data quality, flows, and models. Games reinforce learning in a low pressure way. There are no formal exams; learning evidence comes from activity, reflection, and tracked progress.
