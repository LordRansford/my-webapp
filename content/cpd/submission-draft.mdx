# CPD submission draft responses

## What is the learning objective?
Each course defines learning objectives per level and per section, covering knowledge, application, and judgement. Objectives are written in plain language and aligned to real tasks such as data quality checks, governance decisions, and analysis workflows.

## How is learning measured?
Learning is evidenced through quizzes, interactive tools, and scenario exercises. Progress is tracked with SectionProgressToggle and LevelProgressBar. CPDTracker records time and activity for learner evidence.

## How long does learning take?
Estimated hours are provided per level and per course. Learners record actual time in CPDTracker. The design is self paced with clear guidance to support accurate CPD logging.

## How is quality maintained?
Content follows a structured template, peer review within the platform, and lint/build checks. CI quality gates require explanations, diagrams, tools, and quizzes per section. Internal checklists ensure objectives, accessibility, and practice elements are present.

## How is content kept up to date?
Content is versioned and reviewed regularly. Updates incorporate feedback, evolving standards, and new examples. Internal evidence files document framework alignment to simplify future revisions.
