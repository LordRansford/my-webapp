## Introduction

Security protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Ask three quick questions: what must stay secret, what must stay accurate, and what must stay online? Those answers guide every control.

## Symmetric encryption

One shared key locks and unlocks data. It is fast and proven (AES), but the shared key must be exchanged safely. Think of a locker code: if it leaks, privacy is gone.

**Exercise:** List three ways to share a secret key without email. Pick the safest and explain why.

## Asymmetric encryption

Two keys: a public key to lock, a private key to unlock. Share the public key openly; never share the private key. This removes the need for a pre-shared secret.

<Callout title="Try it" type="info">
Open the RSA sandbox in the tools page or the cybersecurity notes page. Generate a pair, keep the private key safe, and observe how the keys differ.

## Hashing in practice

A hash turns any input into a fixed-length fingerprint. Small input changes produce large output changes. Hashes support integrity checks and password storage (with salts and slow functions).

**Exercise:** Use the SHA-256 sandbox to hash a sentence. Change one word and note how the hash changes.

## Quick check

- Which part stays secret in asymmetric encryption?
- Why does symmetric encryption not solve key exchange on its own?
- When would you choose hashing instead of encryption?
