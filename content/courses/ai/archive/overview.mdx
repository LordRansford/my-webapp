# AI Notes - full course

I built these AI notes because I wanted a single place that explains AI from first principles all the way through to transformers, agents and real systems, without assuming you already speak in equations.

We start with "what is data and what is a model" and slowly climb towards how modern AI systems actually work and how they are governed. You can work through this on your own or use it with students, colleagues or friends.

## Course structure

Three levels, one journey.

- AI Foundations: We start from what data is, how simple models learn patterns, and how to think clearly about accuracy, bias and basic model behaviour.
- Applied AI: We move into evaluation, feature thinking, vector representations, and how to use and tune models in practice without getting lost in buzzwords.
- Modern AI Systems: We explore transformers, agents, diffusion models and how real AI systems are designed, deployed, governed and misused.

You do not have to follow this perfectly in order. If you already use AI at work, skim Foundations and spend more time in Applied and Modern AI Systems. If you are new, move steadily and play with the tools as you go.

## Progression map

You do not have to work through this in order, but it usually helps. If you are completely new to AI, start with Foundations. If you are already a practitioner, you can dip into Applied and Modern AI Systems and use the games and tools as a refresher.

## How this supports CPD and exam prep

I wrote these AI notes to build real, transferable understanding. They are serious CPD-style learning rather than quick tips.

The structure loosely follows the ideas you see in AI fundamentals courses data, models, evaluation, responsible AI and real systems but this is not official training material and I am not claiming certification status.

The goal is to make formal training, vendor platforms, and research papers feel less intimidating so you can apply AI responsibly in real work.

## Tools, labs and AI dashboards

The AI notes include browser-based tools so you can play with simple models, explore evaluation metrics, and visualise embeddings without installing anything. The summary and games page gathers lighter exercises, and the AI tools area lets you go deeper when you are ready.

- AI Foundations: Try the simple model intuition lab and see how basic models learn patterns.
- Applied AI: Work with evaluation and embeddings tools to see how model signals change.
- Modern AI Systems: Look at transformer and agent flows and how real systems are stitched together.
- AI summary and games: Play small games and thought experiments to connect ideas across all three levels.
- AI tools: Jump straight to the AI tool hub when you want to experiment.
