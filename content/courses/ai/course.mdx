## Guiding principles

- Treat models like dependencies: version, verify, and roll them back.
- Separate **retrieval** from **reasoning** so you can swap LLM providers without touching business logic.
- Instrument prompts like code: capture latency, token usage, and drift against golden test sets.

<Callout title="Safety first" type="info">
Align with the CIA triad: confidentiality (PII scrubbing), integrity (input validation and signed outputs), availability (rate protection and graceful degradation).
</Callout>

## Hands-on

- Build a retrieval chain that caches embeddings locally for reproducibility.
- Add lightweight red-teaming prompts to your CI so regressions are caught before deploy.
- Use the Python cell below to experiment with token budgets and latency.
