## AI recap

Thanks for sticking with the AI journey. You moved from labels and data to training, evaluation, and real systems with safety around them. This page is your safe place to revise and play.

## Foundations in one page

Foundations taught the basics: AI is pattern matching, not magic. Data quality and representation shape everything. Supervised learning uses labels, unsupervised learning looks for structure without labels.

<DiagramBlock title="Simple model loop" subtitle="Input to model to output.">
  <div className="grid gap-2 sm:grid-cols-3 text-xs text-slate-700">
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-3">Input</div>
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-3">Model</div>
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-3">Output</div>
  </div>

## Intermediate in one page

Intermediate was about making models work. You clean data, build features, train a model, measure it properly, then serve it with monitoring so it stays honest.

<DiagramBlock title="Applied pipeline" subtitle="Raw data to serving and monitoring.">
  <div className="text-xs text-slate-700">

  title="Quick check: intermediate"
  questions={[
    { q: "What is the loss function", a: "A measure of how wrong the model is." },
    { q: "Why split data", a: "To train, tune, and test honestly." },
    { q: "What does precision measure", a: "How many predicted positives were correct." },
  ]}

## Advanced in one page

Advanced pushed into modern models, agents, and multimodal systems. It also made safety and governance real, because production AI has real impact.

  questions={[
    { q: "What does attention do", a: "It weighs which input parts matter most." },
    { q: "What is an agent", a: "A model that plans steps and uses tools." },
    { q: "Why add guardrails", a: "To reduce harm and misuse." },

## Reflect and next steps

AI is powerful, but it is still a tool. Think about where it would help in your work, and where it would be risky or unhelpful.

<Callout variant="note" title="Your AI story">
Write a few lines on where you might use AI in your own work or study. What would be helpful and what would feel uncomfortable or risky.
</Callout>

If any section felt fuzzy, revisit it. Foundations for clarity, Intermediate for hands on practice, Advanced for real world thinking. The AI Studio labs are always there when you want to go deeper.

You will also find good links between AI and Cybersecurity and Software Architecture. Models are systems. Systems need safety and good design.
