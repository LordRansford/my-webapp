# AI Summary and games

<LevelProgressBar courseId="ai" levelId="summary" sectionIds={aiSectionManifest.summary} />

<CPDTracker courseId="ai" levelId="summary" estimatedHours={4} />

You made it through Foundations, Intermediate and Advanced. This page is a relaxed recap. Use it to test what stuck, spot gaps, and get playful with the ideas before you move on.

## Quick recap

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="ai" levelId="summary" sectionId="ai-summary-concepts" />

Across the track you saw how data turns into tokens and features, how models learn and overfit, and how agents and governance keep AI useful in the real world. This summary keeps the same short sentences and mixes in games so you can rehearse quickly.

## Games and labs hub

These drills are short. Set a timer, play a couple, and notice which ideas feel strong and which feel fuzzy. Everything is CPD aware so your tracker updates as you explore.

  questions={[
    { q: "Why split data into train, validation and test sets", a: "To tune models without cheating and to get an honest final check." },
    { q: "What does attention do in a transformer", a: "It weighs which tokens matter most for the next output." },
    { q: "Name one signal of overfitting", a: "Validation loss rises while training loss falls." },

Use these reflection prompts to close the loop:

- What part of AI feels most interesting to you?
- What part still feels confusing?
- What is one small thing you could try at work or at home?
