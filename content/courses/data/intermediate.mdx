  Data architectures and pipelines
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="data-intermediate-architectures-and-pipelines" />

Data architecture is how data is organised, moved, and protected across systems. It sets the lanes so teams can build without tripping over each other. Pipelines exist because raw data is messy and scattered. They pull from sources, clean and combine, and land it where people and products can use it.

There are two broad ways data moves. Batch means scheduled chunks. Streaming means small events flowing continuously. Both need clear boundaries so one team's changes do not break another's work. If a pipeline fails, dashboards go blank, models drift, and trust drops.

When you design a pipeline, think about ownership at each hop, the contracts between steps, and how to recover when something breaks. A simple diagram often exposes gaps before a single line of code is written.

  Data governance and stewardship
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="data-intermediate-governance-and-stewardship" />

Governance is agreeing how data is handled so people can work quickly without being reckless. Ownership is the person or team that decides purpose and access. Stewardship is the day to day care of definitions, quality, and metadata. Accountability means someone can explain how a change was made and why.

Policies are not paperwork for their own sake. They are guardrails. Who can see a column, how long data is kept, what checks run before sharing. Even a shared spreadsheet is governance in miniature. Who edits, who reviews, what happens when something looks off.

Trust grows when policies are clear, controls are enforced, and feedback loops exist. If a report is wrong and nobody owns it, confidence collapses quickly.

  Interoperability and standards
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="data-intermediate-interoperability-and-standards" />

Interoperability means systems understand each other. It is shared meaning, not just shared pipes. Standards help through common formats, schemas, and naming. A schema is the agreed structure and data types. When systems misalign, data lands in the wrong fields, numbers become strings, or meaning gets lost.

Formats like JSON or CSV carry data, but standards and contracts explain what each field means. An API (application programming interface) without a contract is guesswork. A file without a schema requires detective work.

Small mismatches cause big effects. Dates in different orders, currencies missing, names split differently. Aligning schemas early saves hours of cleanup and prevents silent errors.

  Data analysis and insight generation
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="data-intermediate-analysis-and-insight" />

Analysis is asking good questions of data and checking that the answers hold up. Descriptive thinking asks what happened. Diagnostic thinking asks why. Statistics exist to separate signal from noise. Averages summarise, distributions show spread, trends show direction.

Averages hide detail. A long tail or a split between groups can change the story. Trends can be seasonal or random. Always pair a number with context. When it was measured, who is included, what changed.

Insight is not a chart. It is a statement backed by data and understanding. Decisions follow insight, and they should note assumptions so they can be revisited.

  Risk, ethics and strategic value
</SectionHeader>

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="intermediate" sectionId="data-intermediate-risk-ethics-strategic-value" />

Data risk is broader than security. Misuse, misinterpretation, and neglect can harm people and decisions. Ethics asks whether we should use data in a certain way, not just whether we can. Strategic value comes from using data to improve services, not just to collect more of it.

Risk points appear along the lifecycle. Collection without consent, processing without checks, sharing beyond purpose, keeping data forever. Controls and culture reduce these risks. A small habit, like logging changes or reviewing outliers, prevents large mistakes.

Treat data as a long term asset. Good stewardship, clear value cases, and honest communication build trust that lasts beyond a single project.
