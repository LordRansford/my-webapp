# Data CPD Evidence Mapping

## Course overview
The Data course covers four levels from Foundations through Advanced. It is written for beginners, cross functional teams, and professionals who need a rigorous but accessible path into data. The intent is to build practical fluency across formats, quality, governance, architecture, analytics, and strategic use.

## Learning outcomes
- Knowledge acquisition: terminology, formats, architectures, governance concepts, and mathematical intuition.
- Practical application: hands on tools, scenarios, games, and pipeline thinking that mirror real work.
- Critical thinking: evaluating quality, bias, risk, and trade offs before taking action.
- Professional judgement: aligning data choices with ethics, regulation, architecture, and organisational goals.

## CPD suitability
- Structured learning: four levels with clear progression and tracked sections.
- Progressive difficulty: Foundations for concepts, Intermediate for systems, Advanced for scale and mathematics, Summary for synthesis.
- Reflection and practice: quizzes, games, and scenario tools encourage reflection and iteration.
- Time tracked via CPDTracker: learners record hours and activity locally to support evidence.

## Framework alignment (conceptual, not endorsed)
- Aligned with DAMA DMBOK themes such as data quality, governance, and architecture.
- Consistent with ISO 8000 principles on data quality and stewardship.
- Supports preparation for FAIR data principles: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.
- Aligned with NIST-style thinking on governance, controls, and risk.
- Consistent with UK Government data strategy language on data sharing, quality, and accountability.
