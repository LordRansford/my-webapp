# Data CPD Evidence Mapping

## Course overview
The Data course covers four levels from Foundations through Advanced. It is written for beginners, cross functional teams, and professionals who need a rigorous but accessible path into data. The intent is to build practical fluency across formats, quality, governance, architecture, analytics, and strategic use.

## Learning outcomes
1. Knowledge acquisition. Terminology, formats, architectures, governance concepts, and mathematical intuition.
2. Practical application. Hands on tools, scenarios, games, and pipeline thinking that mirror real work.
3. Critical thinking. Evaluating quality, bias, risk, and trade offs before taking action.
4. Professional judgement. Aligning data choices with ethics, regulation, architecture, and organisational goals.

## CPD suitability
1. Structured learning. Four levels with clear progression and tracked sections.
2. Progressive difficulty. Foundations for concepts, Intermediate for systems, Advanced for scale and mathematics, Summary for synthesis.
3. Reflection and practice. Quizzes, games, and scenario tools encourage reflection and iteration.
4. Time tracked via CPDTracker. Learners record hours and activity locally to support evidence.

## Framework alignment (conceptual, not endorsed)
1. Aligned with DAMA DMBOK themes such as data quality, governance, and architecture.
2. Consistent with ISO 8000 principles on data quality and stewardship.
3. Supports preparation for FAIR data principles. Findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.
4. Aligned with NIST style thinking on governance, controls, and risk.
5. Consistent with UK Government data strategy language on data sharing, quality, and accountability.
