# Data Foundations

<LevelProgressBar courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionIds={dataSectionManifest.foundations} />

<CPDTracker courseId="data" levelId="foundations" estimatedHours={8} />

This level sets out how data exists, moves, and creates value before any heavy analysis or security work. It keeps the language simple, introduces light maths, and shows how real systems depend on data discipline.

## What data is and why it matters

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-what-is-data" />

Data starts as recorded observations: numbers on a meter, text in a form, or pixels in a photo. When we add structure it becomes information that people can read. When we apply it to decisions it becomes knowledge. Data existed long before computers: bank ledgers, census books, medical charts. Modern systems are data driven because every click, sensor, and transaction can be captured and turned into feedback.

Banking relies on clean transaction data to spot fraud. Energy grids depend on meter readings to balance supply and demand. Healthcare teams use lab results and symptoms to guide care. AI systems learn from past data to make predictions, which means they also inherit any gaps or mistakes. Keeping the difference between raw data, information, and knowledge clear helps us avoid mixing facts with opinions.

## Data representation and formats

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-representation-and-formats" />

Computers store everything using bits (binary digits) because hardware can reliably tell two states apart. A byte is eight bits, which can represent 256 distinct values. Encoding maps symbols to numbers, while a file format adds structure on top. CSV is plain text with commas, JSON wraps name value pairs, XML uses nested tags, images store grids of pixels, and audio stores wave samples. The wrong format or encoding breaks systems because the receiver cannot parse what was intended.

A byte can represent 0 to 255. Powers of two help size things: $2^3 = 8$ means three binary places can represent eight values. Plain English: two multiplied by itself three times equals eight. Binary choices stack quickly.

| Item | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Bit | Smallest unit, either 0 or 1 |
| Byte | 8 bits, often one character in simple encodings |
| $2^n$ | Number of combinations with n bits |

## Data quality and meaning

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-quality-and-meaning" />

Quality means data is accurate (close to the truth), complete (not missing key pieces), and timely (fresh enough to be useful). A sensor reading of 21°C is useless if the timestamp is missing. Noise is random variation that hides patterns, while signal is the meaningful part. Bias creeps in when some groups are missing or when measurements are skewed. Models and dashboards inherit these flaws because they cannot tell if the input is wrong.

Context and metadata preserve meaning: units, collection methods, and who collected the data. If a temperature has no unit, is it Celsius or Fahrenheit? Data without context invites bad decisions.

<DiagramBlock title="Clean vs noisy data" subtitle="Quality affects every step">
  <div className="grid gap-3 sm:grid-cols-2 text-xs text-slate-700">

## Data lifecycle and flow

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-lifecycle-and-flow" />

Data starts at collection, gets stored, processed, shared, and eventually archived or deleted. Each step has design choices: where to store, how to process, how to secure, and when to retire. Software architecture cares about where components sit. Cybersecurity cares about protection at each hop. AI pipelines care about how raw data becomes features.

Deletion matters because stale data can mislead, cost money, or breach privacy. A clear lifecycle stops random copies and reduces attack surface.

## Data roles and responsibilities

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-roles-and-responsibilities" />

Roles exist so someone is accountable for quality, access, and change. Data owners make decisions about purpose and access. Data stewards guard definitions, metadata, and policy. Data engineers build and maintain pipelines. Data analysts turn data into insights. Data consumers use the outputs responsibly. When roles blur, pipelines stall, privacy is ignored, or dashboards contradict each other.

## Foundations of data ethics and trust

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="foundations" sectionId="data-foundations-ethics-and-trust" />

Ethics matters from the first data point. Consent means people know and agree to how their data is used. Privacy keeps personal details safe. Transparency builds trust because people can see what is collected and why. Misuse often starts with shortcuts: copying data to test faster or sharing beyond the agreed purpose. Trust erodes slowly and is hard to rebuild.

## How data connects everything you learn next

Data is the common thread across the other courses. AI models are only as good as the data they learn from. Cybersecurity controls protect data wherever it sits or moves. Software systems are structured flows of data shaped by design choices. Digital transformation is largely about improving how data is collected, shared, and trusted across journeys. Think of this page as the root note; the other tracks are variations.

### Shared practice exercises

These exercises appear across courses so you build one habit: always question how data is used, protected, and interpreted.
