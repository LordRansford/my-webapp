## What you now understand about data

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="summary" sectionId="data-summary-recap" />

You have moved from defining data to designing and governing it. Foundations gave you language and habits. Intermediate taught you to design systems and guardrails. Advanced pushed you to reason mathematically, architecturally, and strategically. The real shift is mindset: data work is judgement, context, and humility, not just numbers or tools.

  title="Quick reflection: data mindset"
  questions={[
    { q: "What changed from Foundations to Advanced", a: "A shift from definitions to design, governance, maths, and strategy." },
    { q: "Why is data about judgement", a: "Because context, risk, and uncertainty shape every decision." },
    { q: "What is one habit you adopted", a: "Using progress toggles, tools, and reflection to track learning." },

## Synthesis challenges

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="summary" sectionId="data-summary-scenarios" />

These challenges blend architecture, governance, analytics, and ethics. Treat them as small labs to see how your decisions ripple.

## Games that test your intuition

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="summary" sectionId="data-summary-games-and-labs" />

Lightweight games that surface common mistakes. Play them fast, then replay to see if your instincts change.

## How this connects to everything else you learn here

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="summary" sectionId="data-summary-connections" />

Data fuels AI models and shapes their limits. Data failures lead to cybersecurity incidents and trust loss. Data design and contracts make software architecture coherent. Digital transformation only works when data is collected, shared, and trusted across journeys.

## What to do next

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="data" levelId="summary" sectionId="data-summary-next-steps" />

Replay the tools and games with your own scenarios. Combine lessons across courses: secure data flows, model choices, and architectural patterns. Log your CPD time and reflections. The more you practice, the more these habits become part of how you work.
