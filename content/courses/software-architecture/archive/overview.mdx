# Software Architecture Notes - full course

I built these software architecture notes because I kept bumping into the same problem: resources that drown you in buzzwords or skip straight to cloud diagrams with no story.

Here we start from "what is architecture and why should I care" and move towards the decisions real architects and digital leaders need to make. It is not about pretty boxes; it is about clear thinking on responsibilities, boundaries, change and risk in real systems.

## Course structure

Three levels, one journey.

- Architecture Foundations: Start from what software architecture is for, and how to think about components, boundaries and responsibilities in small systems.
- Applied Architecture: Layered patterns, microservices, events, data ownership and the real trade offs between coupling, performance and changeability.
- Digital and Cloud Scale: Event driven systems, CQRS, integration patterns, observability and digitalisation strategy across whole organisations.

You can read these notes in order like a course or dip into the parts you need. If you are new to architecture, start with Architecture Foundations. If you already lead systems or digital programmes, skim the basics and spend more time in Applied and Digital and Cloud Scale Architecture.

## Progression map

You do not have to follow this perfectly in order. Start at Foundations if you are new; if you already run systems, feel free to hop into Applied and Digital and Cloud Scale Architecture and use the tools as refreshers.

## How this fits into professional development

These notes are designed to support real professional work in software architecture and digitalisation. They are calm, practical, and meant for CPD, not quick tips.

They lean on ideas you see in layered and hexagonal architectures, domain driven design thinking, cloud native patterns and integration guidance, but they are my view rather than an official training manual.

The aim is to make it easier to talk to architects, engineers, vendors and regulators, and to give you something solid to point to for CPD logs and performance reviews.

## Tools, labs and dashboards

The architecture notes include interactive tools to sketch systems, explore request flows, reason about data ownership and boundaries, and visualise quality attributes, trade offs and risk. Dashboards add more hands-on scenarios around performance, resilience and change.

- Architecture Foundations: Sketch a simple system and practice drawing clear boundaries and responsibilities.
- Applied Architecture: Explore microservice and event flows, plus data ownership and coupling trade offs.
- Digital and Cloud Scale: Look at CQRS, integration patterns, observability and large scale trade off dashboards.
- Summary and games: Join up diagrams, patterns and digitalisation ideas with small applied challenges.
