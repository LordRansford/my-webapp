# Software Development and Architecture Advanced

<LevelProgressBar courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" sectionIds={softwareArchitectureSectionManifest.advanced} />

<CPDTracker courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" estimatedHours={14} />

Advanced architecture is about running big systems across many teams. You design for change, failures, and the messy reality of long lived software.

## Domains and bounded contexts

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" sectionId="soft-arch-advanced-domain-and-bounded-contexts" />

Domain driven design starts with language. A <GlossaryTip term="domain">The core problem space your software is meant to solve.</GlossaryTip> is not the same as a UI screen. A <GlossaryTip term="bounded context">A boundary where terms have one clear meaning.</GlossaryTip> keeps teams aligned.

<GlossaryTip term="ubiquitous language">
Shared words that mean the same thing to developers, product, and domain experts.
</GlossaryTip>

When contexts blur, systems become expensive to change. Clear language and boundaries protect velocity.

<DiagramBlock title="Bounded contexts" subtitle="Split the domain where language changes.">
  <div className="grid gap-2 sm:grid-cols-3">
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-3 text-xs text-slate-700">

## Advanced patterns and distributed systems

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" sectionId="soft-arch-advanced-patterns-and-distribution" />

<GlossaryTip term="CQRS">
Command Query Responsibility Segregation, where writes and reads use different models.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="event sourcing">
Store changes as a stream of events instead of overwriting records.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="saga">
A long business process split into steps with recovery paths if a step fails.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="idempotent">
Safe to run more than once without changing the final outcome.
</GlossaryTip>

These patterns help when you need scale and clarity, but they add complexity. Use them when the problem demands it.

## Resilience, performance and scale

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" sectionId="soft-arch-advanced-resilience-performance" />

Failures will happen. Resilience is about what you do when they do. <GlossaryTip term="circuit breaker">A safety switch that stops calls when a dependency is failing.</GlossaryTip> protects systems from cascades. <GlossaryTip term="backpressure">A way to slow or shed load so the system stays stable.</GlossaryTip> keeps things alive.

Caching helps, but it creates new risks. Always decide where stale data is acceptable.

## Architecture evolution and governance

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="advanced" sectionId="soft-arch-advanced-evolution-and-governance" />

<GlossaryTip term="fitness function">
An automated check that ensures architecture rules stay true over time.
</GlossaryTip>

<GlossaryTip term="technical debt">
Work you postpone now that will cost more to fix later.
</GlossaryTip>

Architects guide change with small decisions, not massive documents. ADRs make intent visible. Fitness checks catch drift early.
