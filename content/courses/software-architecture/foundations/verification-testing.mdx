# Verification and Testing

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionId="soft-arch-foundations-verification-testing" />

Testing is how you know your system works. Not hope, not faith, actual evidence. This module covers test strategies, security verification, accessibility testing, and performance validation.

## Test strategy pyramid

<GlossaryTip term="test pyramid">The test pyramid is a strategy for balancing different types of tests, with many fast unit tests at the base and fewer slow end-to-end tests at the top</GlossaryTip> helps you balance cost, speed, and coverage.

**CPD Evidence:**
- Estimated time: 3.5 hours
- Module covers test pyramid, OWASP ASVS, WCAG 2.2 accessibility, and performance testing

**Note:** This is a demonstration stub showing the structure. Full implementation would include detailed content for test strategies, security verification, accessibility testing with WCAG 2.2, and performance testing approaches.
