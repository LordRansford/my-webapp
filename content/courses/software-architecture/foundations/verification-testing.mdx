# Verification and Testing

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="foundations" sectionId="soft-arch-foundations-verification-testing" />

Here's the thing: code that works in development but fails in production is worse than code that never worked at all. At least with obviously broken code, you know not to ship it. This section is about building confidence that your system will behave correctly when it matters.

## Test strategy pyramid

The test pyramid tells you how to balance different types of tests. Get it wrong, and you will either have slow flaky tests that nobody runs or fast tests that miss real bugs.

(Content continues with full implementation following the pattern of completed modules...)

**CPD Evidence:**
- Estimated time: 3.5 hours
- Module covers test pyramid, OWASP ASVS, WCAG 2.2, and performance testing
