# Software Development and Architecture: Summary and games

<LevelProgressBar courseId="software-architecture" levelId="summary" sectionIds={softwareArchitectureSectionManifest.summary} />

This page is a light recap and a play space. Use it to refresh the big ideas and test your instincts.

## You made it to the end

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="summary" sectionId="soft-arch-summary-you-made-it" />

You started with the basics of systems and roles. You moved through architecture styles and integration. You finished with domains, resilience, and evolution. That is real progress.

- Foundations gave you clear mental models and shared language.
- Intermediate showed how styles and integration patterns shape trade offs.
- Advanced pushed into domains, distributed patterns, and long term governance.

You now have the core vocabulary to ask better questions and design safer systems.

</DiagramBlock>

We started with one system and grew to many. Quality attributes like performance and reliability shape every decision. <GlossaryTip term="bounded context">A boundary where terms have one clear meaning.</GlossaryTip> keeps large systems understandable. Patterns like <GlossaryTip term="CQRS">Command Query Responsibility Segregation, which separates reads and writes.</GlossaryTip> exist to handle complexity when you truly need them.

## What next

<SectionProgressToggle courseId="software-architecture" levelId="summary" sectionId="soft-arch-summary-next-steps" />

If diagrams still feel fuzzy, revisit Foundations. If integration or data felt heavy, revisit Intermediate. If domains and distributed patterns need time, revisit Advanced and pick one topic to go deeper on.

You can also keep practicing in the Software Development Studio, and log your learning in [My CPD](/cpd).

Architecture is a team sport. You do not have to carry every detail in your head. Use notes, diagrams, and shared language.
