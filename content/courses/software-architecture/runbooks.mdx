## Operability as design

- Every service has a **runbook** with steady-state SLOs, alerts, and safe to retry guidance.
- **ADRs** capture trade-offs and security posture. Link to threat models and test evidence.
- **Golden paths**: templates for new services with logging, metrics, and trace exports enabled by default.

## Sample ADR outline

- Context: what changed in the business layer?
- Decision: what pattern or control did we select?
- Consequences: which risks reduce, which move, which increase?
- Verification: how do we know it works (tests, synthetic probes, chaos experiments)?

<Callout title="Availability + Integrity" type="warning">
Ensure your rollback plan preserves data integrity. Include schema versioning and compensating actions in the runbook.
