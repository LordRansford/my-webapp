## Objectives

- Tie every capability to a measurable outcome and a security intent.
- Use the **C4 model** for clarity and the **SABSA layer stack** for assurance.
- Keep non-functional requirements visible by default: latency, availability, privacy, and operability.

<Callout title="Separation of concerns" type="info">
Content lives in MDX; application logic stays in React; styling lives in CSS variables. That mirrors TOGAF's content, application, data, and technology layers.
</Callout>

## Artefacts you will produce

- **Capability map** that traces to epics and service ownership.
- **Service contracts** that capture ingress, egress, and trust zones.
- **Decision records (ADRs)** for trade-offs. Each ADR references threat models and runbooks.
