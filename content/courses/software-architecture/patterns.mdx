## Choosing boundaries

- Decompose by **business capability**, not by database table.
- Protect **data ownership**: the service that owns data enforces rules; consumers read via contracts.
- Prefer asynchronous integration for resilience; reserve sync calls for user journeys that need immediacy.

## C4 sketch to start

1. Context: who uses the system and why?
2. Container: which deployable units exist and which trust zone are they in?
3. Component: how do modules expose capabilities and guardrails?
4. Code: link to docs and linters that enforce the rules.

Automate what you can (linting, contract tests, dependency checks) so architects review intent, not syntax.
