## What you will build

- A repeatable threat model using the **CIA triad** tied to each OSI layer.
- A control stack that stays traceable from intent through to enforcement.
- A cryptography habit you can trust because it runs on the Web Crypto API, not ad-hoc code.

<Callout title="Architect first, then automate" type="info">
Keep the intent clear at each step: who is protected, what matters most, and how each layer defends it.
</Callout>

## Controls by layer

- **Business**: Define who is protected and why. Record the value-at-risk, sponsor, and acceptable downtime.
- **Information (Data)**: Classify what flows across the OSI stack. Label PII, secrets, and operational telemetry separately.
- **Application**: Enforce least privilege in code paths. Prefer signed tokens over shared secrets. Short TTLs, zero implicit trust.
- **Technology**: Harden the platform - network segmentation, mTLS between services, and SBOMs for every deployable.

## How to study

1. Skim the overview, then jump into the RSA lab to verify your cryptographic assumptions.
2. Use the CIA traceability list below as your checklist during architecture reviews.
3. Connect to related courses: see [Software Architecture](/software-architecture) for system design patterns, and [Data](/data) for data governance that supports security controls.
4. Share your own playbooks by dropping new MDX lessons into `content/courses/cybersecurity/`.

## CIA traceability checklist

- Confidentiality: classification present, key management defined, access logged and alerting active.
- Integrity: signed artefacts, reproducible builds, change control with approvals.
- Availability: capacity plan, DoS strategy, backup + restore tested with RTO/RPO targets.
