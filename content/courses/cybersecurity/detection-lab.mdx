## Signals that matter

- **Network (OSI 3-4)**: flow logs, TLS fingerprints, rate anomalies.
- **Application (OSI 5-7)**: auth failures by IP, token reuse, impossible travel, schema misuse.
- **Platform (OSI 1-2)**: CPU throttling, packet drops, kernel logs, node restarts.

## Build the response muscle

1. Create a "golden path" request and response sample for each critical user journey.
2. Write one detection per journey that flags data exfil, tampering, or abuse.
3. Simulate failure: kill a service, expire a token early, or inject a fake credential leak.

Recovery time objectives are part of security. Include rollback, cache warmers, and graceful degradation in your runbooks.

## Quick OSI-to-control map

- Physical/Data Link: link monitoring, port isolation, 802.1X.
- Network: zero trust segmentation, egress allow-listing.
- Transport: mTLS with rotated client certs, cipher suite policy.
- Session/Presentation/Application: JWT expiry, content validation, WAF rules tuned to your domain vocabulary.
