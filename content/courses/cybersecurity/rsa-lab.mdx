## Why RSA here?

RSA still underpins S/MIME, VPNs, and legacy identity providers. When you control the key lifecycle you control the blast radius.

<Callout title="Good defaults" type="success">
Uses the Web Crypto API with `RSA-OAEP`, SHA-256, and exportable keys. No home-grown crypto, no server calls.
</Callout>

## Generate a pair

Pick your modulus length. 2048 is balanced for most web apps; 4096 is safer but slower on constrained devices.

## Hardening tips

- Store private keys in an HSM or KMS where possible; if local, encrypt at rest and rotate.
- Use different key pairs for transport (RSA-OAEP) and signing (RSA-PSS or ECDSA).
- Keep PEMs short-lived. Automate rotation via CI/CD, and prefer mTLS between services for machine identity.
