# Digitalisation Notes - full course

I think of digitalisation as the boring but beautiful work of joining up data, people, processes and technology so that real life gets easier instead of harder.

These notes start from first principles about what digitalisation is and why it matters, then move towards platforms, data sharing, operating models and strategy. The aim is to help you talk confidently to engineers, policy people, business leaders and regulators without getting lost in jargon.

## Course structure

Three levels, one journey.

- Digitalisation Foundations: Start with what digitalisation means, how data, people, processes and systems fit together, and how to read basic diagrams and operating models.
- Applied Digitalisation: Platforms, integration, data sharing, capabilities, and how organisations design digital journeys and services in practice.
- Digital Strategy and Enterprise Scale: Digital roadmaps, operating models, governance, regulation and how to align data, architecture and people at sector or enterprise scale.

You can move through this like a course or jump to the level that matches your role. If you are new to digital work, start with Foundations. If you already lead projects or programmes, skim the basics and spend more time in Applied and Digital Strategy and Enterprise Scale.

## Progression map

You do not need to follow this perfectly in order. Foundations helps if you are new; if you already drive digital work, dip into Applied and Digital Strategy and Enterprise Scale and use the tools as refreshers.

## How this fits into professional development

These notes support CPD for digital, data and transformation roles. They are calm, practical, and written from doing the work, not selling a framework.

The structure lines up with ideas you see in digital government, platform thinking and data-centric regulation, but this is my view rather than official guidance.

Use it for CPD logs, to prepare for digital roles, or to have more grounded conversations with vendors and consultants.

## Tools, labs and dashboards

The digitalisation notes include interactive tools to map simple processes, explore capabilities and platforms, think about data sharing, consent and governance, and play with small what-if scenarios. Dashboards pull these views together so you can see data, flows and decisions in one place.

- Digitalisation Foundations: Map a basic process to a digital journey and see where data and people interact.
- Applied Digitalisation: Explore capability or platform maps and how integration patterns shape delivery.
- Digital Strategy and Enterprise Scale: Look at roadmap and operating model views to see how strategy, governance and data align.
- Summary and games: Join up platforms, data and strategy with small applied challenges.
