# Useful tools - Software architecture

<div className="mt-2 rounded-3xl bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-sky-50/40 to-slate-50 border border-slate-100 px-4 py-4 sm:px-6 sm:py-5">

    These tools sit beside my software architecture notes. They help us see
    trade offs in latency, availability and context before we jump into code
    or detailed diagrams. Use them as quick labs when you are talking with
    teams about performance, reliability and system boundaries.
