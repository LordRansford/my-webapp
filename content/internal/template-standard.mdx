# Template Standard (Internal)

This document is the single source of truth for every premium template and dashboard. It exists for maintainers and Codex context only; end users never see this page.

## Purpose of templates
- Deliver reusable, real-world-grade assets that accelerate delivery across domains.
- Stay legally safe: every asset must be authorised for reuse and clearly licensed.
- Remain consistent: identical structure, metadata, accessibility, and export behaviour across all templates.

## Legal and attribution rules
- Default licence: attribution required for commercial use; internal or personal use may remove attribution.
- Mandatory inclusions on commercial downloads: author name, brand, attribution notice. These must not be stripped in PDFs, docs, or dashboards.
- Attribution removal for commercial use requires either an approved donation route or explicit written permission.
- Include a standard attribution block component on every template page; gating logic must run at download/export time (placeholder for now).

## Structural layout rules (cannot be bypassed)
- All templates must render inside `src/components/templates/TemplateLayout.jsx`.
- Required sections, in order:
  1. Title and short description
  2. Intended audience and use cases
  3. Instructions on how to use the template
  4. Editable form or dashboard area
  5. Output and interpretation section
  6. Licence and attribution notice
- Shared building blocks live in `src/components/templates`: `TemplateHeader`, `TemplateInstructions`, `TemplateFormSection`, `TemplateOutput`, `TemplateLicenceNotice`.
- No template may omit or reorder these sections. Placeholder copy is acceptable while the template is under construction.

## Template taxonomy
Top-level categories (non-negotiable). Each category must provide Planning, Design, Execution, and Monitoring/Reporting templates.
- Cybersecurity
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data and Information
- Software Architecture
- Digitalisation and Strategy
- Engineering Systems
- Governance and Regulation
- Risk and Assurance
- Operations and Delivery

## Metadata requirements (critical)
- Author must be set to Ransford (or the designated owner) on every exported artifact.
- Organisation name must be present; do not mention AI, generators, OpenAI, or automation anywhere in document properties.
- Keep document properties minimal and clean (title, author, organisation, version, and category only).
- Use `src/utils/templateMetadata.js` during export to inject compliant metadata.

## Accessibility and inclusivity baseline
- Minimum base font size: 16px for body, 18px+ for headings; avoid text set below 14px anywhere.
- Colour contrast: WCAG AA or better; avoid colour-only distinctions.
- Keyboard: all interactive elements in templates must be reachable and operable via keyboard (logical tab order, visible focus).
- Screen readers: every form field requires an explicit label; provide aria-live regions for dynamic output where relevant.
- Language: prefer short sentences, avoid jargon without definitions, include inline help where workflows may be unclear.

## Export rules
- Exports must carry licence and attribution per the legal rules above.
- Metadata injection is mandatory for all exports (PDF, DOCX, CSV, dashboards). No automated/AI tool references permitted.
- Gating for commercial attribution removal must trigger before download; until implemented, show a placeholder control and log intent.
- Generated files must not include tracking pixels, external calls, or embedded secrets.

## Implementation notes for Codex
- Use the shared layout and components; do not invent per-template structures.
- Add tests and linting for metadata handling once export logic exists.
- Preserve this standard as authoritative; updates must keep backward compatibility with existing templates or document migration steps.
