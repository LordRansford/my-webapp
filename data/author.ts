      title: "Why this site exists",
      content: [
        "I built this website for people who love technical things and want to become genuinely good at them, but do not always know where to start. That includes people like me and my wife who are neurodivergent, and plenty of neurotypical people too.",
        "A lot of technical content fails not because it is hard, but because it is badly explained. Concepts are wrapped in unexplained jargon, assumptions are left unstated, and if you miss one step, the whole explanation collapses. That makes deep understanding almost impossible, especially if you need clarity rather than vibes.",
        "So many of us end up teaching ourselves because the alternatives are frustrating, vague, or frankly unhelpful.",
        "This site exists to fix that.",
        "Everything here is designed to take you from absolute beginner to real expertise, step by step, with explanations that do not skip logic, practical experiments you can actually try, and quizzes that test understanding rather than memorisation. The aim is not to impress you with complexity, but to remove it where it is unnecessary and explain it properly where it is not.",
        "If something cannot be explained clearly, it probably is not understood properly. That principle underpins the entire site."

      title: "Who I am",
      content: [
        "Hi, I’m Ransford Chung Amponsah.",
        "I grew up in Ghana and moved to the UK at 16 to continue my education and be closer to family. I have always loved learning technical subjects and, just as importantly, teaching them in a way people can actually digest. I learn best by understanding how things really work, and I enjoy exchanging ideas with people who care about getting things right rather than sounding clever.",
        "By background, I am a Chartered Engineer and a TOGAF Certified Practitioner, with formal training in AI including Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) and Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102). For my day job, I work as a senior manager in digitalisation for the GB energy sector as a regulator, leading sector-wide data and digital strategy and shaping how complex systems evolve in practice, not just on paper.",
        "Alongside that, I volunteer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers as a Council Member and Professional Reviewer, including chartership applications. I have also worked as a Mechanical Engineering Lecturer, teaching mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles to HNC, HND, and A-level students. Teaching reinforced something I already suspected: clarity beats cleverness every time.",
        "I will spare you the rest of the qualifications. This is not a CV and that is very much intentional."

      title: "Outside of work",
      content: [
        "When I am not thinking about systems, architecture, or teaching, I am usually training. I enjoy powerlifting and bodybuilding and am currently chasing a 300 kg squat and a 100 kg incline dumbbell press. Progress is slow, measurable, and humbling, which I find oddly comforting.",
        "I also love table tennis and used to play in local leagues, picking up a few borough-level championship trophies along the way. At home, I enjoy DIY projects and am currently building a garden to grow flowers for my wife, along with some fruit and vegetables. Engineering habits die hard.",
        "I am very into motorbikes and prefer to maintain, modify, and occasionally dismantle them myself. Past and present bikes include a UM Commando, a Triumph Rocket 3 GT (2022), a Honda NC750X (2025), and a Honda CB125R (2025). I also tinker with robotics as a hobbyist, mostly because it combines logic, hardware, and patience in equal measure.",
        "For balance, I enjoy anime, with One Piece currently holding the crown, and I am always happy to watch K-dramas, shows like Love Is Blind, or detective films such as the Knives Out series with my dear wife. I enjoy cooking, catching up with friends, and spending time with our cat, Sesame, who runs the house.",
        "Most importantly, I am deeply grateful for my church family, for my wider family, and above all to God for my wife and the people around me. Their wisdom, patience, and guidance matter more to me than any professional achievement."

      title: "The short version",

        "This site is here to make hard things understandable, without dumbing them down.",
        "It is built for people who want depth, clarity, and honesty.",
        "If that sounds like you, you are in the right place."
