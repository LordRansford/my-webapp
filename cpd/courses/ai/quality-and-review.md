# Quality and review – AI

- Review cadence: quarterly; faster for correctness issues.
- Corrections: logged and patched with CI gates (lint, build, CPD checks).
- Change control: git history, pull requests, automated guards.
- References: prefer reputable research labs, standards bodies, and vendor-neutral docs.
