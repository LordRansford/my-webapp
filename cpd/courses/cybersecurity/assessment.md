# Assessment – Cybersecurity

- **Quiz thresholds**: default pass ≥70%; retries allowed to encourage mastery.
- **Retake policy**: unlimited, with feedback on correct answers where available.
- **Labs/tools**: completion recorded via tool interactions (TLS, DNS, IP reputation, WHOIS).
- **Completion for certificate**: all sections complete, at least one quiz completed per level, tool usage recorded, CPD time derived server side.
- **Integrity**: certificates issued only from server-verified progress; IDs are non-guessable; verification page exposes safe summary only.
