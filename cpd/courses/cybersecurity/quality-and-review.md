# Quality and review – Cybersecurity

- **Review cadence**: quarterly content sweep; ad-hoc fixes when errors are reported.
- **Corrections**: triaged within 5 business days; critical fixes pushed immediately.
- **Change control**: git history; pull request review; CI gates (lint, build, CPD quality, secret scan).
- **References policy**: prefer vendor-neutral, standards-based sources; cite primary specs or reputable bodies when adding claims.
- **Regression prevention**: automated guards for CPD metadata, access control, security headers, and template safety; Node tests for CPD calculations.
