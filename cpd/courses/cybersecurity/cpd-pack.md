# CPD Pack – Cybersecurity

## Course purpose and audience
- Practical cybersecurity foundations for practitioners and aspiring security professionals.
- Target: learners with basic IT awareness; no formal security prerequisite. Gentle on-ramp with optional deeper labs.

## Learning outcomes
- Understand core security principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability, least privilege, defense in depth).
- Interpret common threats and apply mitigations across network, application, and cloud contexts.
- Perform structured threat modelling and basic incident response planning.
- Evaluate TLS posture, DNS hygiene, and email security signals.
- Communicate risk and remediation recommendations clearly.

## Syllabus structure (self paced web)
- Levels: Foundations, Applied, Practice.
- Modes: reading, guided walkthroughs, embedded tools, short reflections.

## Delivery method
- Self paced web learning with embedded tools and quizzes. Optional labs use lightweight in-browser exercises.

## Assessment strategy
- Quizzes per section with clear correctness feedback.
- Tool-based tasks (TLS inspect, DNS lookup, IP reputation, WHOIS summary) recorded as learning signals.
- Reflections encouraged via prompts; not graded.
- Completion requires all sections marked complete and at least one quiz passed.

## Evidence of learning time
- Estimated hours from course frontmatter per level; capped by server-side CPD calculator.
- Earned minutes derived from completed sections, quizzes, and tool usage; no client-supplied hours.

## Accessibility and inclusivity
- Plain language, keyboard accessible components, reduced motion honoured.
- No audio requirement; transcripts inherent in text content.
- Inclusive tone; no assumptions of prior security expertise.

## Update and versioning policy
- Content reviewed on a scheduled cadence (see quality-and-review.md).
- Versioned by git; course meta includes estimatedHours per level.
- Changes recorded in CPD packs and mapping files.
